&quot; The potential productivity gains should be considerable .
Today , QuarkXPress ® 8 has tighter integration with Photoshop ® and Illustrator ® than ever before , and through standards like HTML and CSS , QuarkXPress users can publish across media both independently and alongside Adobe ® Creative Suite ® applications like Adobe Flash ® ( SWF ) and Adobe Dreamweaver ® .
Here , you ’ ll find out how Creative Suite users can get the best possible interaction with QuarkXPress .
You ’ ll be surprised how easy Quark has made it to unlock the full potential of all your design software .
QuarkXPress 8 is considered by many to have the best integration with Photoshop ’ s PSD file format of any layout tool available today .
In this section we ’ ll explain when you should use the PSD format for your images and how to get the most out of them .
For example , you may have multiple layers in your PSD with different product shots , which will vary from publication to publication .
If you use PSD , you can switch those layers on or off in QuarkXPress without having to save a separate TIFF for each publication .
Another question that might tip you in favor of PSD is , &quot; Do I need to use a spot color with this image ?
&quot; Using spot colors in most image formats is often complicated .
However , because of the way QuarkXPress supports PSD channels , it ’ s simpler and more flexible .
Bringing the PSD files into QuarkXPress is the same as any other image . Create a Box and then use File &gt; Import ... or simply drag and drop the image from your desktop , Finder or an application like Adobe Bridge ® with or without creating a box first .
To access the special features of PSD , open the PSD Import palette . ( Window &gt; PSD Import ) You ’ ll instantly see thumbnails of the layers along with their names .
For example , you ’ ve created a layer in Photoshop to give your image an antiqued look , but when you put it in your layout it seems swamped by the surrounding colors . One option might be to reduce the opacity of that layer by clicking on it and entering a new opacity level .
If you want to add an extra ink or plate to your images , you can set up a channel to do that in Photoshop . For example , maybe you intend to varnish part of an image , or you want to use a spot color within your image .
QuarkXPress can re ­ map any channel right in the PSD Import palette — non ­ destructively .
So click on the channels divider of the PSD Import Palette ; double click on the channel in question , and you can pick any color from your project ’ s color palette , ensuring consistency .
As powerful as the PSD support of QuarkXPress 8 is , it can ’ t manipulate certain kinds of layers , such as layer effects &#91; e.g.
If you use one of these layers , the image will import and print just fine , but you won ’ t get access to the layer controls of the PSD Import palette .
If you need that functionality , you can eliminate those kinds of layers from your PSD by converting the layer effects to stand ##AT##-##AT## alone layers or &apos; smart objects &apos; &#91; right click on the Layer in the Photoshop layers palette &#93; .
QuarkXPress supports text layers , most adjustment layers , and even 3D layers including opacity and blending mode controls .
Illustrator is a great tool for creating logos and vector illustrations .
Traditionally , the route into QuarkXPress has been to export an EPS from Illustrator .
Now , things are made much easier with the arrival of direct Illustrator .ai file import into QuarkXPress 8 .
Simply drag and drop or import your Illustrator native file into your layout just as you would any graphics file format .
QuarkXPress has a powerful transparency engine , but it doesn ’ t support partially transparent objects in PDF or .ai files yet .
So if you are using something like a drop shadow in Illustrator and plan to place that over a non ##AT##-##AT## white background or object , you might see undesirable results .
The good news is that the drop shadow and transparency features of QuarkXPress works on imported Illustrator files , so you can apply a drop shadow or change the opacity of your .ai file right in your layout instead .
QuarkXPress is well equipped for drawing tasks and in our newest release we have standardised many of our graphics tools to work more like Illustrator , Freehand and similar tools .

Barbecue and Mate Tea are Argentinian inventions with a social function .
Many Argentinian families have in their own grill in the backyard of their homes ( called parrillas ) , where they meet on the weekends for a meal together with friends and relatives .
The beef here has different cuts to that of Europe .

Like in Europe , meat is prepared rare , mid rare , done , well done etc .
The sauce which comes with the meat dish is called &quot; chimichurri &quot; . However , because of the excellent taste of the meat , it can well be eaten without sauce .
A full plate of mixed grill contains practically all animal innards from various animals .
The Sausage ( chorizo ) and the black pudding ( morcilla ) are very popular .
Served with the meats are vegetables ( sweet potatoes , pumpkin puree ) and mixed salads .
In a restaurant it is of course possible to order other parts of meats .
Depending on the season and region , it is possible to eat in Argentina very good food and meat such as deer , lamb , sheep , goat , fish , and other seafood .
Special delicacies are : king prawns ( centolla ) from Tierra de Fuego and wild boar ( jabalí ) or trout in Bariloche .
Special dishes , going back as far as colonial times are : &quot; pastel de choclo &quot; or the &quot; humita &quot; .
More typical are chicken &quot; pollo &quot; in its most varied prepartions , &quot; milanesa &quot; ( Viennese escalope ) , &quot; empanadas &quot; ( fried pastry shells filled with chopped beef , chicken , maize or cheese and ham ) or &quot; choripan &quot; similar to a Hot Dog .
Many Italian restaurants are found here which serve pizza and pasta .
Next to fresh fruit salads and good ice cream , a wide range of desserts are offered .
Two Argentine specialities are the &quot; dulce de leche &quot; , milk ##AT##-##AT## caramel marmalade which is also used to as a bread spread and the &quot; alfajores &quot; ( small cake ##AT##-##AT## formed biscuits with different fillings ) .

This section holds the most general questions about PHP : what it is and what it does .
Can I run several versions of PHP at the same time ?
What are the differences between PHP 3 and PHP 4 ?
What are the differences between PHP 4 and PHP 5 ?
I think I found a bug ! Who should I tell ?
Much of its syntax is borrowed from C , Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP ##AT##-##AT## specific features thrown in .
The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly .
This confuses many people because the first word of the acronym is the acronym .
This type of acronym is called a recursive acronym .
For more information , the curious can visit » Free On ##AT##-##AT## Line Dictionary of Computing or the » Wikipedia entry on recursive acronyms .
PHP / FI 2.0 is an early and no longer supported version of PHP .
PHP 3 is the successor to PHP / FI 2.0 and is a lot nicer .
PHP 5 is the current generation of PHP , which uses the » Zend engine 2 which , among other things , offers many additional OOP features .
Please see the » What &apos;s new in PHP 4 overview for a detailed explanation of these features and more .
While PHP 5 was purposely designed to be as compatible as possible with previous versions , there are some significant changes .
For more detailed information , please view the section on Migrating from PHP 4 to PHP 5 and the section on Backwards Incompatible Changes .
You should go to the PHP Bug Database and make sure the bug isn &apos;t a known bug .
If you don &apos;t see it in the database , use the reporting form to report the bug .
It is important to use the bug database instead of just sending an email to one of the mailing lists because the bug will have a tracking number assigned and it will then be possible for you to go back later and check on the status of the bug .

Note : Note that JPC and JP2 are capable of having components with different bit depths .
In this case , the value for &quot; bits &quot; is the highest bit depth encountered .
Also , JP2 files may contain multiple JPEG 2000 codestreams .
In this case , getimagesize ( ) returns the values for the first codestream it encounters in the root of the file .

It can reference a local file or ( configuration permitting ) a remote file using one of the supported streams .
This optional parameter allows you to extract some extended information from the image file .
Currently , this will return the different JPG APP markers as an associative array .
Some programs use these APP markers to embed text information in images .
A very common one is to embed » IPTC information in the APP13 marker .
You can use the iptcparse ( ) function to parse the binary APP13 marker into something readable .
Returns an array with 7 elements .
Index 0 and 1 contains respectively the width and the height of the image .
Note : Some formats may contain no image or may contain multiple images .
In these cases , getimagesize ( ) might not be able to properly determine the image size. getimagesize ( ) will return zero for width and height in these cases .
Index 2 is one of the IMAGETYPE ##UNDERSCORE## XXX constants indicating the type of the image .
Index 3 is a text string with the correct height = &quot; yyy &quot; width = &quot; xxx &quot; string that can be used directly in an IMG tag .
channels will be 3 for RGB pictures and 4 for CMYK pictures .

For the last few years the European Patent Office ( EPO ) has , contrary to the letter and spirit of the existing law , granted more than 30000 patents on rules of organisation and calculation claimed in terms of general ##AT##-##AT## purpose computing equipment , called &quot; programs for computers &quot; in the law of 1973 and &quot; computer ##AT##-##AT## implemented inventions &quot; in EPO Newspeak since 2000 .
Europe &apos;s patent movement is pressing to legitimate this practise by writing a new law .
Although the patent movement has lost major battles in November 2000 and September 2003 , Europe &apos;s programmers and citizens are still facing considerable risks .
Here you find the basic documentation , starting from the latest news and a short overview .
The patent movement has during several decades won the support of large corporations and governments for its expansionist cause .
Yet FFII , Eurolinux and others have devoted themselves to this work with considerable success .
Still , we continue to have more tasks than free hands .
Here we tell you how you can help us move forward more quickly .
A database of the monopolies on programming problems , which the European Patent Office has granted against the letter and spirit of the existing laws , and about which it is unsufficiently informing the public , delivering only chunks of graphical data hidden behind input masks .
The FFII software patent workgroup is trying to single out the software patents , make them better accessible and show their effects on software development .
During the last few years , the European Patent Office ( EPO ) has granted several 10000 patents on computer ##AT##-##AT## implemented rules of organisation and calculation , i.e. programs for computers &#91; as such &#93; .
We are systematically collecting these patents and republishing them in a more accessible form .

It ’ s the last month of the year … time to look back on this year and time to embrace the new one .
For the Kindo team it was a very exciting one and we are busy working in the arms of the MyHeritage family .
You can read the announcement here ( pdf ) , or get the complete FAQ here , but I wanted to give you some more background on why Kindo and MyHeritage have teamed up .
The first time we met Gilad , the founder and CEO of Myheritage , was in early 2007 – a few weeks before we released the first public version of Kindo .
Gareth and me were invited to have lunch with him in Soho in central London , and went there with the objective of learning everything we could about the “ enemy ” .
This proved to be pretty naive , since Gilad is much too nice to be called an “ enemy ” .
But there we were : A Swede , a South African and an Israeli , all with very different professional background and life stories , talking about the future of families online from very different perspectives .
I didn ’ t expect this , but we found that we had much in common .
We shared the same ideas and vision for what we wanted to achieve with our businesses , even though our approach was far from similar .
Kindo had set out to build a site that would help you interact with the family that is around you here and now .
We were trying to come up with tools to help you share information and communicate with the people that matter most to you right now .
MyHeritage on the other hand had developed amazing technologies to help you find out everything about your family ’ s history , and had spent years perfecting these technologies .
Ultimately though , what interested us both was the opportunity to help families discover more about who they are and their past , and use the web to bring them closer together .
As Gareth and I travelled back on the tube , we talked about how nice it would be to be able to offer our own users the same tools as MyHeritage already had .
What really got us excited was their SmartMatching Technology , which matches people in your family tree with 250 Million other names , and suggests who you might be related too .
During this summer , we ’ ve been thinking long and hard about the future of Kindo , and what the best option would be for taking Kindo to the next level .
The more time we spent with Gilad as well as the rest of the team in Israel ( not to mention the very loud rooster that runs around in their campus ) , the more convinced we all became - we ’ ll be better off together .
So we join the MyHeritage family because we share the same vision and values ( as families should ) , and because we think that we can build an amazing product together – bringing real benefits to families around the world .
This is what we ’ re planning to do over the next years .
As you see from the smiles in the picture below , this is a happy day for us here in the Putney Offices .
This years Swedish Genealogy Days the yearly conference of the Swedish Federation of Genealogical Societies was held in the city of Malmö in the province of Skåne in southern Sweden .
Over 100 exibitors crowded in the convention center at Europaporten in Malmö . Everything from genealogical societies , archives to companies offering original sources online .
In the meanwhile , you can still work on your profiles and upload the photos from the weekend ’ s family reunion .
Update : Now everything is fixed ! It was the database acting a bit weird but Stephen has done a great job to fix it .
Everyone hits a brick wall in genealogy , where the birth and death records just aren ’ t easy to find . In that case , try some different records .
Deeds often contain information on who sold what to whom ; who inherited what from whom ; or how some land was divided among a family . Historic tax records on land also sometimes have interesting information , such as co ##AT##-##AT## ownership .
Just as the squirrels and different kinds of birds collect nuts and seeds , someone in the Kindo office seems to be doing some really solid forward planning .
Judging from this picture - it ’ s going to be a looong winter .
As I point out in my book , Genealogy Online 8th Edition , you can do a lot of good research using search engines and Boolean operators ( AND , NOT , OR , and parentheses . ) Recently , Yahoo !
Advanced Google still accepts the most popular Boolean terms , and Exalead even supports the NEAR operator , which really helps with common surnames , but Live Search is now the only major search engine with full Boolean support .
For more details on how to do the Boolean Boogie for genealogy , read Genealogy Online 8th Edition .
Most beginners to genealogy are fuzzy about cousinship . For example , while many understand first cousins are people with common grandparents , many folks confuse first cousin once removed and second cousin .
Then , there are families like mine : My mother ’ s siblings were born from 1911 to 1932 . That means her youngest brother “ Mike ” went to school with the oldest sister ’ s oldest child , his niece “ Karen ” .
As it turned out , Uncle “ Mike ” and niece “ Karen ” married two people who were siblings , “ Michelle ” and “ Kevin ” , making their children both first cousins and first cousins once removed .
Showing degrees of relationship by blood .
“ Using DNA is one of the newest and latest tools of tracing your genealogy , and it ’ s remarkable , ” said Wells , who represented Family Tree DNA . ” You can see if they migrated , you can find out more about your great ##AT##-##AT## aunt and maybe she acted strangely , but that was because she had a baby die at childbirth … you just never know what secrets the past will reveal , ” Wells said .
-First it does not replace paper documentation since it does not name common ancestors , it is more a tool to prove lineage .
Several companies , like Family Tree DNA , can assist you to confirm your family tree or allow you to determine whether two people are related if you give them DNA of someone .
- It ’ s less reffective for females to use DNA than for males because thanks to Y ##AT##-##AT## DNA , we can determine paternal and maternal lines , whereas for females it is just maternal .
Here are a few suggestions to get you started : Introduction to Genealogy from National Genealogical Society ( U.S. ) Most genealogists take this course first . It is very American ##AT##-##AT## centric , but the techniques can be applied to any country ’ s vital statistics .

Lufthansa owes its origins to &quot; Deutsche Luft Hansa Aktiengesellschaft &quot; ( renamed &quot; Lufthansa &quot; in 1933 ) , which is formed from a merger between &quot; Deutsche Aero Lloyd &quot; ( DAL ) and &quot; Junkers Luftverkehr &quot; on January 6 .
The new airline inherits its crane logo , designed by &quot; Deutsche Luft ##AT##-##AT## Reederei &quot; in 1919 , from DAL , the blue ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## yellow house colours from Junkers .
It commences scheduled flights on April 6 with a fleet of 162 aircraft , of 18 different types .
A flying expedition to China is the event of the year .
Following its acquisition of shares in 1926 in the German ##AT##-##AT## Russian &quot; Dereluft &quot; airline , which was founded in 1921 , Lufthansa is influential in the founding of the Spanish Iberia , the Brazilian &quot; Syndicato Condor &quot; and the Chinese &quot; Eurasia &quot; airlines .
Lufthansa opens the first trans ##AT##-##AT## oceanic , scheduled airmail service across the South Atlantic .
Between 1936 and 1938 , it also experiments with scheduled air services across the North Atlantic .
After substantial expansion of the route network in 1939  including flights to Bangkok and Santiago de Chile  wartime air services , except for a few European countries , are suspended .
All flights are discontinued in 1945 and Lufthansa goes into receivership and is finally wound up and struck from the Berlin commercial register in 1965 .
The Federal Transport Minister sets up a working committee in 1951 to prepare for the resumption of air traffic in postwar Germany and entrusts the job of implementation to &quot; Büro Bongers &quot; , the office headed by Hans M. Bongers , the traffic chief of the old Lufthansa in Cologne . A new company to run air services and named &quot; Aktiengesellschaft für Luftverkehrsbedarf &quot; ( Luftag ) is founded in Cologne on January 6 , 1953 .
Lufthansa enters the jet age , initially on long ##AT##-##AT## haul routes , with the arrival in the fleet of the Boeing 707 .
The last of the propeller ##AT##-##AT## driven aircraft , a Vickers Viscount , is retired in 1971 .
Conversion to jet aircraft continues with the start of flights on medium ##AT##-##AT## haul routes with the Boeing 727 and , on short ##AT##-##AT## haul , with the Boeing 737 , the city jet largely fathered by Lufthansa .
The wide ##AT##-##AT## body era begins at Lufthansa with the delivery of its first Boeing 747 jumbo jet in 1970 , later to be joined by the McDonnell ##AT##-##AT## Douglas DC10 and the A300 , the first of the jets from the newly founded European aircraftmaker .
Lufthansa resumes flights to Berlin 45 years after the end of World War Two following Germany &apos;s reunification .
Lufthansa masters its worst ##AT##-##AT## ever economic crisis with a sweeping rehabilitation programme .
The airline , largely owned by the state , is privatised step by step .
Its MRO , cargo and IT businesses are spun off as independent companies .
Lufthansa , Air Canada , SAS , Thai Airways und United Airlines create the &quot; Star Alliance &quot; , the world &apos;s first multilateral airline grouping , later to be joined by other carriers .
The Lufthansa Aviation Group equips itself for the new millenium , training its focus on innovation and quality .
Placement of orders for 15 Airbus A380 megaliners charts the airline ’ s path into the future .
Even during times of crisis in the aviation industry , Lufthansa remains on the ascent : With the “ Future European Operations “ programme , the airline reorganises its regional markets , while gaining new partner airlines to expand the Star Alliance global route network .
Passengers enjoy greater comfort in a completely revamped Business Class with fast broadband Internet connectivity in the aircraft cabin .
Lufthansa creates new perspectives for Germany &apos;s future as a business location : Lufthansa orders 20 Boeing 747 ##AT##-##AT## 8s and is the launch customer for the aircraft .
Preparations for the A380 include route proving with Airbus , a new A380 maintenance hangar and a new terminal area in Frankfurt .
The Lufthansa Aviation Center becomes an architectural flagship .
Lufthansa Cargo founds the cargo airline AeroLogic with DHL Express .
Further partners strengthen the Star Alliance , which now encompasses 21 members .

There is finally an official answer to the question of whether or not WordPress themes must “ inherit ” the GPL license that WordPress itself uses .
Matt asked the Software Freedom Law Center to examine the WordPress source and how themes fit in . The final , official answer to whether themes must be GPL ?
The WordPress Plugin Competition is the best moment of the year , plugin wise .
This year ’ s edition is still running till the end of the month of July and as of writing , there are about 10 plugins ( with some really interesting stuff ) . Still , new plugins are released every day .
Why aren ’ t these authors joining the competition ? Participating in the competition is Instructive : you ##STAR## will ##STAR## learn something .
If WordPress were a country , our Bill of Rights would be the GPL because it protects our core freedoms .
We ’ ve always done our best to keep WordPress.org clean and only promote things that are completely compatible and legal with WordPress ’ license .
There have been some questions in the community about whether the GPL applies to themes like we ’ ve always assumed .
The Official WordPress Commercial Theme Directory is now open . It is linked off the WordPress Extend and is part of the parent theme directory set of links .
It is not as much a directory as it is a listing of sites that offer commercial GPL themes .
If you aren ’ t already following along , I highly recommend checking out the How To Create A WordPress Theme tutorial series by Ian Stewart ( ThemeShaper.com ) .
This 12 ##AT##-##AT## part series ( 8 complete at the time of this writing ) aims to take you from nothing to a fully functional , semantically rich , flexible WordPress theme in digestible chunks .
Along the way , Ian describes the changes being made , and why you are making them .
A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the WordPress Plugin Related Sites plugin .
An exploit is available in the wild and available on Milw0rm , making this attack easier to exploit .
Although , the vulnerability says that version 2.1 is vulnerable .
You should assume previous versions are vulnerable as well .

Beta 2 is here . Get it while it ’ s … still not quite out of Beta … or something .
Dev4Press has done some interesting work on benchmarking various aspects of WordPress and then testing out some popular questions on page loads etc .
The methodologies are well documented and the benchmarking setup is standardized .
They are testing three version of WordPress including 2.6.5 , 2.7.1 and 2.8 ( I wish they would have waited for 2.8.1 to be released ) .
Are you one of those worried about the progress of your WordPress blog ? Do you wanna know how your visitors found you and how they interact with your site ?
Well , it requires you to drill down the site analytics to get to the bottom .

It &apos;s not uncommon that a blog runs by different authors , so it may be useful if you can have a quick look at the drafts of all authors .
In our joint blog WP Engineer we created a feed , which keeps us up to date if a new draft of all authors were created . The work of every author is different and the dashboard is the center of information .
Therefore we have decided to supplement a widget in the Dashboard , which shows the last five drafts of all authors . I enhanced the existing Plugin Draft Feed .

Since so many people are having simple problems with their WordPress 2.8 installations , the WordPress community is working tirelessly to get a point ##AT##-##AT## one update out as soon as possible , and the first step on that road is to test a beta of the release .
WordPress 2.8.1 Beta 1 has been released , and they need people to test it out and see if it fixes the problems , so if you are having issues with WordPress 2.8 , try the beta , and see if that resolves it .
Some plugins are causing grief for those upgrading to 2.8 . HyperDB needs to be updated to the latest version , otherwise tags won ’ t save .
Plugins that load old versions of jQuery for all admin pages will break all kinds of stuff . Plugins should use the version of jQuery that ships with WP .

Lottery remains for centuries one of the most common forms of gambling endorsed by governments worldwide .
The very first signs of this popular trend take us way back to the Han Dynasty in the Far East where a Lottery was used to aid in the finance of major governmental projects , targeted mainly to glorify the government and its people .
The game of Lottery is very strongly printed in today � s culture and even celebrated with splendor as we approach the holiday season .
The biggest celebration by far takes us to our neighboring Spain , where locals participate and enjoy Spain � s national Christmas lottery game known as � El Gordo � ( The Fat One ) , since 1812 .
As well as being one of the oldest lotteries around , the total prize pool in recent years , have surpassed the 2 billion Euro mark , making it also the biggest lottery worldwide ! !
With prizes being so high , more than 100 new millionaires are produced every Christmas .
� � El Gordo � works differently to most lottery games played , as countless people can share one single ticket .
A whole lottery ticket ( � billete � ) costs a few thousand Euros but these tickets are split to smaller sections , each costing around 20 Euros .
This means that many , even strangers , may share a whole ticket .
The idea is quite befitting especially now , in holiday season where many people in one community share a grand prize worth millions .
Such an event can even affect the local economy .
The El Gordo takes place every 22nd of December and again on the 5th of January .
The whole drawing process takes at least three hours to complete , with the entire community tuned to the radio in suspense .
Participation is also available through the internet , so now you don � t necessarily have to be in Spain in order to enter this grand lottery event .

The Lord warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness .
His journeyings in the wilderness , and so forth .
Lehi prophesies of a land of liberty — His seed shall be scattered and smitten if they reject the Holy One of Israel — He exhorts his sons to put on the armor of righteousness .
1 And now it came to pass that after I , Nephi , had made an end of teaching my brethren , our a father , Lehi , also spake many things unto them , and rehearsed unto them , how great things the Lord had done for them in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem .
2 And he spake unto them concerning their a rebellions upon the waters , and the mercies of God in sparing their lives , that they were not swallowed up in the sea .
3 And he also spake unto them concerning the land of promise , which they had obtained — how a merciful the Lord had been in b warning us that we should flee out of the land of Jerusalem .
4 For , behold , said he , I have a seen a b vision , in which I know that c Jerusalem is d destroyed ; and had we remained in Jerusalem we should also have e perished .
5 But , said he , notwithstanding our afflictions , we have obtained a a land of promise , a land which is b choice above all other lands ; a land which the Lord God hath c covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed .
Yea , the Lord hath d covenanted this land unto me , and to my children forever , and also all those who should be e led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord .
6 Wherefore , I , Lehi , prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me , that there shall a none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord .
7 Wherefore , this a land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring .
And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given , it shall be a land of b liberty unto them ; wherefore , they shall never be brought down into captivity ; if so , it shall be because of iniquity ; for if iniquity shall abound c cursed shall be the land for their sakes , but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever .
8 And behold , it is wisdom that this land should be a kept as yet from the knowledge of other b nations ; for behold , many nations would overrun the land , that there would be no place for an inheritance .
9 Wherefore , I , Lehi , have obtained a a promise , that b inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments , they shall c prosper upon the face of this land ; and they shall be kept from all other nations , that they may possess this land unto themselves .
And if it so be that they shall d keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land , and there shall be none to molest them , nor to take away the land of their e inheritance ; and they shall dwell safely forever .
11 Yea , he will bring a other nations unto them , and he will give unto them power , and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions , and he will cause them to be b scattered and smitten .
12 Yea , as one generation passeth to another there shall be a bloodsheds , and great visitations among them ; wherefore , my sons , I would that ye would remember ; yea , I would that ye would hearken unto my words .
13 O that ye would awake ; awake from a deep a sleep , yea , even from the sleep of b hell , and shake off the awful c chains by which ye are bound , which are the chains which bind the children of men , that they are carried away captive down to the eternal d gulf of misery and woe .
and arise from the dust , and hear the words of a trembling a parent , whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent b grave , from whence no traveler can c return ; a few more d days and I go the e way of all the earth .
15 But behold , the Lord hath a redeemed my soul from hell ; I have beheld his b glory , and I am encircled about eternally in the c arms of his d love .
16 And I desire that ye should remember to observe the a statutes and the judgments of the Lord ; behold , this hath been the anxiety of my soul from the beginning .
18 Or , that a a cursing should come upon you for the space of b many generations ; and ye are visited by sword , and by famine , and are hated , and are led according to the will and captivity of the c devil .
19 O my sons , that these things might not come upon you , but that ye might be a choice and a a favored people of the Lord .
But behold , his will be done ; for his b ways are righteousness forever .
20 And he hath said that : a Inasmuch as ye shall keep my b commandments ye shall c prosper in the land ; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence .
22 That ye may not be a cursed with a sore cursing ; and also , that ye may not incur the displeasure of a b just God upon you , unto the destruction , yea , the eternal destruction of both soul and body .
23 Awake , my sons ; put on the armor of a righteousness .
Shake off the b chains with which ye are bound , and come forth out of obscurity , and arise from the dust .
24 Rebel no more against your brother , whose views have been a glorious , and who hath kept the commandments from the time that we left Jerusalem ; and who hath been an instrument in the hands of God , in bringing us forth into the land of promise ; for were it not for him , we must have perished with b hunger in the wilderness ; nevertheless , ye sought to c take away his life ; yea , and he hath suffered much sorrow because of you .
25 And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you , lest he shall suffer again ; for behold , ye have a accused him that he sought power and b authority over you ; but I know that he hath not sought for power nor authority over you , but he hath sought the glory of God , and your own eternal welfare .
26 And ye have murmured because he hath been plain unto you .
Ye say that he hath used a sharpness ; ye say that he hath been angry with you ; but behold , his b sharpness was the sharpness of the power of the word of God , which was in him ; and that which ye call anger was the truth , according to that which is in God , which he could not restrain , manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities .
27 And it must needs be that the a power of God must be with him , even unto his commanding you that ye must obey .
But behold , it was not he , but it was the b Spirit of the Lord which was in him , which c opened his mouth to utterance that he could not shut it .
28 And now my son , Laman , and also Lemuel and Sam , and also my sons who are the sons of Ishmael , behold , if ye will hearken unto the voice of Nephi ye shall not perish .
And if ye will hearken unto him I leave unto you a a blessing , yea , even my first blessing .
29 But if ye will not hearken unto him I take away my a first blessing , yea , even my blessing , and it shall rest upon him .
30 And now , Zoram , I speak unto you : Behold , thou art the a servant of Laban ; nevertheless , thou hast been brought out of the land of Jerusalem , and I know that thou art a true b friend unto my son , Nephi , forever .
31 Wherefore , because thou hast been faithful thy seed shall be blessed a with his seed , that they dwell in prosperity long upon the face of this land ; and nothing , save it shall be iniquity among them , shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face of this land forever .
32 Wherefore , if ye shall keep the commandments of the Lord , the Lord hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with the seed of my son .
Redemption cometh through the Holy Messiah — Freedom of choice ( agency ) is essential to existence and progression — Adam fell that men might be — Men are free to choose liberty and eternal life .
1 And now , Jacob , I speak unto you : Thou art my a first -born in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness .
And behold , in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow , because of the rudeness of thy brethren .
2 Nevertheless , Jacob , my first ##AT##-##AT## born in the wilderness , thou knowest the greatness of God ; and he shall consecrate thine a afflictions for thy gain .
3 Wherefore , thy soul shall be blessed , and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother , Nephi ; and thy days shall be a spent in the service of thy God .
Wherefore , I know that thou art redeemed , because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer ; for thou hast b beheld that in the c fulness of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men .
4 And thou hast a beheld in thy youth his glory ; wherefore , thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh ; for the Spirit is the same , yesterday , today , and forever .
And the way is prepared from the fall of man , and b salvation is c free .
5 And men are instructed sufficiently that they a know good from evil .
And the b law is given unto men .
And by the law no flesh is c justified ; or , by the law men are d cut off .
Yea , by the temporal law they were cut off ; and also , by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good , and become miserable forever .
6 Wherefore , a redemption cometh in and through the b Holy c Messiah ; for he is full of d grace and truth .
7 Behold , he offereth himself a a sacrifice for sin , to answer the ends of the law , unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit ; and unto b none else can the c ends of the law be answered .
8 Wherefore , how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth , that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God , a save it be through the merits , and mercy , and grace of the Holy Messiah , who b layeth down his life according to the flesh , and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit , that he may bring to pass the c resurrection of the dead , being the first that should rise .
9 Wherefore , he is the firstfruits unto God , inasmuch as he shall make a intercession for all the children of men ; and they that believe in him shall be saved .
10 And because of the intercession for a all , all men come unto God ; wherefore , they stand in the presence of him , to be b judged of him according to the truth and c holiness which is in him .
11 For it must needs be , that there is an a opposition in all things .
If not so , my first ##AT##-##AT## born in the wilderness , righteousness could not be brought to pass , neither wickedness , neither holiness nor misery , neither good nor bad .
Wherefore , all things must needs be a compound in one ; wherefore , if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead , having no life neither death , nor corruption nor incorruption , happiness nor misery , neither sense nor insensibility .
12 Wherefore , it must needs have been created for a thing of naught ; wherefore there would have been no a purpose in the end of its creation .
Wherefore , this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes , and also the power , and the mercy , and the b justice of God .
13 And if ye shall say there is a no law , ye shall also say there is no sin .
If ye shall say there is no sin , ye shall also say there is no righteousness .
And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness .
And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery .
And if these things are not b there is no God .
And if there is no God we are not , neither the earth ; for there could have been no creation of things , neither to act nor to be acted upon ; wherefore , all things must have vanished away .
14 And now , my sons , I speak unto you these things for your profit and a learning ; for there is a God , and he hath b created all things , both the heavens and the earth , and all things that in them are , both things to act and things to be c acted upon .
15 And to bring about his eternal a purposes in the end of man , after he had b created our first parents , and the beasts of the field and the c fowls of the air , and in fine , all things which are created , it must needs be that there was an opposition ; even the d forbidden e fruit in f opposition to the g tree of life ; the one being sweet and the other bitter .
16 Wherefore , the Lord God gave unto man that he should a act for himself .
Wherefore , man could not b act for himself save it should be that he was c enticed by the one or the other .
17 And I , Lehi , according to the things which I have read , must needs suppose that an a angel of God , according to that which is written , had b fallen from heaven ; wherefore , he became a c devil , having sought that which was evil before God .
18 And because he had fallen from heaven , and had become miserable forever , he a sought also the misery of all mankind .
Wherefore , he said unto Eve , yea , even that old serpent , who is the devil , who is the father of all b lies , wherefore he said : Partake of the forbidden fruit , and ye shall not die , but ye shall be as God , c knowing good and evil .
19 And after Adam and Eve had a partaken of the forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of b Eden , to till the earth .
20 And they have brought forth children ; yea , even the a family of all the earth .
21 And the days of the children of a men were prolonged , according to the b will of God , that they might c repent while in the flesh ; wherefore , their state became a state of d probation , and their time was lengthened , according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men .
For he gave commandment that all men must repent ; for he showed unto all men that they were e lost , because of the transgression of their parents .
22 And now , behold , if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen , but he would have remained in the garden of Eden .
And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created ; and they must have remained forever , and had no end .
23 And they would have had no a children ; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence , having no b joy , for they knew no misery ; doing no good , for they knew no c sin .
24 But behold , all things have been done in the wisdom of him who a knoweth all things .
25 a Adam b fell that men might be ; and men c are , that they might have d joy .
26 And the a Messiah cometh in the fulness of time , that he may b redeem the children of men from the fall .
And because that they are c redeemed from the fall they have become d free forever , knowing good from evil ; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon , save it be by the punishment of the e law at the great and last day , according to the commandments which God hath given .
27 Wherefore , men are a free according to the b flesh ; and c all things are d given them which are expedient unto man .
And they are free to e choose f liberty and eternal g life , through the great Mediator of all men , or to choose captivity and death , according to the captivity and power of the devil ; for he seeketh that all men might be h miserable like unto himself .
29 And not choose eternal death , according to the will of the flesh and the a evil which is therein , which giveth the spirit of the devil power to b captivate , to bring you down to c hell , that he may reign over you in his own kingdom .
30 I have spoken these few words unto you all , my sons , in the last days of my probation ; and I have chosen the good part , according to the words of the prophet .
And I have none other object save it be the everlasting a welfare of your souls .
The Gods finish their planning of the creation of all things — They bring to pass the creation according to their plans — Adam names every living creature .
1 And thus we will finish the heavens and the earth , and all the a hosts of them .
2 And the Gods said among themselves : On the seventh time we will end our work , which we have counseled ; and we will a rest on the b seventh time from all our work which we have counseled .
3 And the Gods concluded upon the seventh time , because that on the seventh time they would a rest from all their b works which they ( the Gods ) counseled among themselves to form ; and c sanctified it .
And thus were their decisions at the time that they counseled among themselves to form the heavens and the earth .
5 According to all that which they had said concerning every plant of the field before it was in the a earth , and every herb of the field before it grew ; for the Gods had not caused it to rain upon the earth when they counseled to do them , and had not formed a man to till the ground .
6 But there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
7 And the a Gods formed man from the b dust of the ground , and took his c spirit ( that is , the man ’ s spirit ) , and put it into him ; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life , and man became a living d soul .
8 And the Gods planted a garden , eastward in a Eden , and there they put the man , whose spirit they had put into the body which they had formed .
9 And out of the ground made the Gods to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food ; the a tree of life , also , in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
10 There was a river running out of Eden , to water the garden , and from thence it was parted and became into four heads .
11 And the Gods took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden , to dress it and to keep it .
13 But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it ; for in the time that thou eatest thereof , thou shalt surely die .
Now I , Abraham , saw that it was after the Lord ’ s a time , which was after the time of b Kolob ; for as yet the Gods had not appointed unto Adam his reckoning .
14 And the Gods said : Let us make an help meet for the man , for it is not good that the man should be alone , therefore we will form an help meet for him .
16 And of the rib which the Gods had taken from man , formed they a a woman , and brought her unto the man .
18 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall a cleave unto his wife , and they shall be b one flesh .
19 And they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not a ashamed .
20 And out of the ground the Gods formed every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air , and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them ; and whatsoever a Adam called every living creature , that should be the name thereof .
21 And Adam gave a names to all b cattle , to the fowl of the air , to every beast of the field ; and for Adam , there was found an c help meet for him .
Men are called as high priests because of their exceeding faith and good works — They are to teach the commandments — Through righteousness they are sanctified and enter into the rest of the Lord — Melchizedek was one of these — Angels are declaring glad tidings throughout the land — They will reveal the actual coming of Christ .
1 And again , my brethren , I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children ; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God a ordained priests , after his holy order , which was after the order of his Son , to teach these things unto the people .
2 And those priests were ordained after the a order of his Son , in a b manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption .
3 And this is the manner after which they were ordained — being a called and b prepared from the c foundation of the world according to the d foreknowledge of God , on account of their exceeding faith and good works ; in the first place being left to e choose good or evil ; therefore they having chosen good , and exercising exceedingly great f faith , are g called with a holy calling , yea , with that holy calling which was prepared with , and according to , a preparatory redemption for such .
4 And thus they have been a called to this holy calling on account of their faith , while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and b blindness of their minds , while , if it had not been for this they might have had as great c privilege as their brethren .
9 Thus they become a high priests forever , after the order of the Son , the Only Begotten of the Father , who is without beginning of days or end of years , who is full of b grace , equity , and truth .
11 Therefore they were called after this holy order , and were a sanctified , and their b garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb .
12 Now they , after being a sanctified by the b Holy Ghost , having their garments made white , being c pure and spotless before God , could not look upon d sin save it were with e abhorrence ; and there were many , exceedingly great many , who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God .
13 And now , my brethren , I would that ye should humble yourselves before God , and bring forth a fruit meet for repentance , that ye may also enter into that rest .
14 Yea , humble yourselves even as the people in the days of a Melchizedek , who was also a high priest after this same order which I have spoken , who also took upon him the high priesthood forever .
15 And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid a tithes ; yea , even our father Abraham paid tithes of one ##AT##-##AT## tenth part of all he possessed .
16 Now these a ordinances were given after this b manner , that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God , it being a c type of his order , or it being his order , and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins , that they might enter into the rest of the Lord .
18 But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith , and received the office of the high priesthood according to the a holy order of God , did preach repentance unto his people .
And behold , they did repent ; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days ; therefore he was called the prince of peace , for he was the king of Salem ; and he did reign under his father .
19 Now , there were a many before him , and also there were many afterwards , but b none were greater ; therefore , of him they have more particularly made mention .
20 Now I need not rehearse the matter ; what I have said may suffice .
Behold , the a scriptures are before you ; if ye will b wrest them it shall be to your own destruction .
22 Yea , and the voice of the Lord , by the a mouth of angels , doth declare it unto all nations ; yea , doth declare it , that they may have glad tidings of great joy ; yea , and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people , yea , even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth ; wherefore they have come unto us .
23 And they are made known unto us in a plain terms , that we may understand , that we cannot err ; and this because of our being b wanderers in a strange land ; therefore , we are thus highly favored , for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard .
24 For behold , a angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our land ; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his glory .
25 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us by the mouth of angels , of his coming ; for the time cometh , we a know not how soon .
Would to God that it might be in my day ; but let it be sooner or later , in it I will rejoice .
26 And it shall be made known unto a just and holy men , by the mouth of angels , at the time of his coming , that the words of our fathers may be fulfilled , according to that which they have spoken concerning him , which was according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them .
29 a Having faith on the Lord ; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life ; having the b love of God always in your hearts , that ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his c rest .
30 And may the Lord grant unto you repentance , that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you , that ye may not be a bound down by the chains of b hell , that ye may not suffer the second c death .
31 And Alma spake many more words unto the people , which are not written in a this book .
Revelation given through Joseph Smith , at Manchester , New York , March 1830 . HC 1 : 72 – 74 .
1 – 3 , Christ has all power ; 4 – 5 , All men must repent or suffer ; 6 – 12 , Eternal punishment is God ’ s punishment ; 13 – 20 , Christ suffered for all , that they might not suffer if they would repent ; 21 – 28 , Preach the gospel of repentance ; 29 – 41 , Declare glad tidings .
1 I am a Alpha and Omega , b Christ the Lord ; yea , even I am he , the beginning and the end , the Redeemer of the c world .
3 Retaining all a power , even to the b destroying of Satan and his works at the c end of the world , and the last great day of judgment , which I shall pass upon the inhabitants thereof , d judging every man according to his e works and the deeds which he hath done .
4 And surely every man must a repent or b suffer , for I , God , am c endless .
5 Wherefore , I a revoke not the judgments which I shall pass , but woes shall go forth , weeping , b wailing and gnashing of teeth , yea , to those who are found on my c left hand .
6 Nevertheless , it is a not written that there shall be no end to this torment , but it is written b endless c torment .
7 Again , it is written a eternal damnation ; wherefore it is more express than other scriptures , that it might work upon the hearts of the children of men , altogether for my name ’ s glory .
8 Wherefore , I will explain unto you this a mystery , for it is meet unto you to know even as mine apostles .
9 I speak unto you that are chosen in this thing , even as one , that you may enter into my a rest .
10 For , behold , the a mystery of godliness , how great is it !
For , behold , I am b endless , and the punishment which is given from my hand is endless c punishment , for d Endless is my name .
11 a Eternal punishment is God ’ s punishment .
15 Therefore I command you to repent — repent , lest I a smite you by the rod of my mouth , and by my wrath , and by my anger , and your b sufferings be sore — how sore you know not , how exquisite you know not , yea , how hard to bear you know not .
19 Nevertheless , glory be to the Father , and I partook and a finished my preparations unto the children of men .
20 Wherefore , I command you again to repent , lest I a humble you with my almighty power ; and that you b confess your sins , lest you suffer these c punishments of which I have spoken , of which in the smallest , yea , even in the least degree you have d tasted at the time I withdrew my Spirit .
21 And I command you that you a preach naught but repentance , and show b not these things unto the world until it is wisdom in me .
22 For they cannot a bear meat now , but b milk they must receive ; wherefore , they must not know these things , lest they perish .
23 a Learn of me , and listen to my words ; b walk in the c meekness of my Spirit , and you shall have d peace in me .
24 I am Jesus Christ ; I a came by the b will of the Father , and I do his will .
25 And again , I command thee that thou shalt not a covet thy b neighbor ’ s c wife ; nor seek thy neighbor ’ s life .
27 Which is my word to the a Gentile , that soon it may go to the b Jew , of whom the Lamanites are a c remnant , that they may believe the gospel , and look not for a d Messiah to come who has already come .
28 And again , I command thee that thou shalt a pray b vocally as well as in thy heart ; yea , before the world as well as in secret , in public as well as in private .
29 And thou shalt a declare glad tidings , yea , b publish it upon the mountains , and upon every high place , and among every people that thou shalt be permitted to see .
30 And thou shalt do it with all humility , a trusting in me , b reviling not against revilers .
31 And of a tenets thou shalt not talk , but thou shalt declare repentance and b faith on the Savior , and c remission of sins by d baptism , and by e fire , yea , even the f Holy Ghost .
32 Behold , this is a great and the last a commandment which I shall give unto you concerning this matter ; for this shall suffice for thy daily walk , even unto the end of thy life .
33 And misery thou shalt receive if thou wilt slight these a counsels , yea , even the destruction of thyself and property .
34 a Impart a portion of thy property , yea , even part of thy lands , and all save the support of thy b family .
35 Pay the a debt thou hast b contracted with the printer .
Release thyself from c bondage .
37 And a speak freely to all ; yea , preach , exhort , declare the b truth , even with a loud voice , with a sound of rejoicing , crying — Hosanna , hosanna , blessed be the name of the Lord God !
38 a Pray always , and I will b pour out my Spirit upon you , and great shall be your blessing — yea , even more than if you should obtain c treasures of earth and corruptibleness to the extent thereof .
39 Behold , canst thou read this without a rejoicing and lifting up thy heart for b gladness ?
40 Or canst thou run about longer as a a blind guide ?
41 Or canst thou be a humble and meek , and conduct thyself wisely before me ?
Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon , at or near Fayette , New York , December 1830 . HC 1 : 128 – 131 .
At this time the Prophet was engaged almost daily in making a translation of the Bible .
The translation was begun as early as June 1830 , and both Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer had served as scribes .
Since they had now been called to other duties , Sidney Rigdon was called by divine appointment to serve as the Prophet ’ s scribe in this work ( verse 20 ) .
As a preface to his record of this revelation the Prophet wrote : “ In December Sidney Rigdon came &#91; from Ohio &#93; to inquire of the Lord , and with him came Edward Partridge . .
1 – 2 , How men may become the sons of God ; 3 – 7 , Sidney Rigdon is called to baptize and confer the Holy Ghost ; 8 – 12 , Signs and miracles are wrought by faith ; 13 – 16 , The Lord ’ s servants shall thrash the nations by the power of the Spirit ; 17 – 19 , Joseph Smith holds the keys of the mysteries ; 20 – 21 , The elect shall abide the day of the Lord ’ s coming ; 22 – 27 , Israel shall be saved .
1 Listen to the voice of the a Lord your God , even b Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end , whose c course is one d eternal round , the e same today as yesterday , and forever .
2 I am Jesus Christ , the Son of God , who was a crucified for the sins of the world , even as many as will b believe on my name , that they may become the c sons of God , even d one in e me as I am f one in the Father , as the Father is one in me , that we may be one .
3 Behold , verily , verily , I say unto my servant Sidney , I have looked upon thee and thy works .
I have a heard thy prayers , and prepared thee for a greater work .
4 Thou art blessed , for thou shalt do great things .
Behold thou wast sent forth , even as a John , to prepare the way before me , and before b Elijah which should come , and thou knewest it not .
6 But now I give unto thee a commandment , that thou shalt a baptize by water , and they shall receive the b Holy Ghost by the laying on of the c hands , even as the apostles of old .
7 And it shall come to pass that there shall be a great work in the land , even among the a Gentiles , for their b folly and their abominations shall be made manifest in the eyes of all people .
8 For I am God , and mine arm is not a shortened ; and I will show b miracles , c signs , and wonders , unto all those who d believe on my name .
9 And whoso shall ask it in my name in a faith , they shall b cast out c devils ; they shall heal the d sick ; they shall cause the blind to receive their e sight , and the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak , and the lame to walk .
11 But a without faith shall not anything be shown forth except b desolations upon c Babylon , the same which has made d all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her e fornication .
12 And there are a none that doeth good except those who are ready to b receive the fulness of my gospel , which I have sent forth unto this generation .
14 And their arm shall be my arm , and I will be their a shield and their buckler ; and I will gird up their loins , and they shall fight manfully for me ; and their b enemies shall be under their feet ; and I will let c fall the d sword in their behalf , and by the e fire of mine indignation will I preserve them .
16 And they shall learn the parable of the a fig -tree , for even now already summer is nigh .
18 And I have given unto him the a keys of the mystery of those things which have been b sealed , even things which were from the c foundation of the world , and the things which shall come from this time until the time of my coming , if he d abide in me , and if not , e another will I plant in his stead .
19 Wherefore , watch over him that his faith fail not , and it shall be given by the a Comforter , the b Holy Ghost , that knoweth all things .
21 For they will hear my a voice , and shall b see me , and shall not be c asleep , and shall d abide the day of my e coming ; for they shall be f purified , even as I am pure .
22 And now I say unto you , a tarry with him , and he shall journey with you ; forsake him not , and surely these things shall be fulfilled .
23 And a inasmuch as ye do not write , behold , it shall be b given unto him to prophesy ; and thou shalt preach my gospel and call on c the holy prophets to prove his words , as they shall be given him .
25 And a Israel shall be b saved in mine own due time ; and by the c keys which I have given shall they be led , and no more be confounded at all .
26 a Lift up your hearts and be glad , your b redemption draweth nigh .
27 Fear not , little a flock , the b kingdom is yours until I come .
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , on the bank of the Missouri River , McIlwaine ’ s Bend , August 12 , 1831 . HC 1 : 202 – 205 .
On their return trip to Kirtland the Prophet and ten elders had traveled down the Missouri River in canoes .
On the third day of the journey many dangers were experienced .
Elder William W. Phelps , in daylight vision , saw the destroyer riding in power upon the face of the waters .
1 – 12 , The Lord has decreed many destructions upon the waters ; 13 – 22 , The waters were cursed by John , and the destroyer rideth upon their face ; 23 – 29 , Some have power to command the waters ; 30 – 35 , Elders are to journey two by two and preach the gospel ; 36 – 39 , They are to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man .
1 Behold , and hearken unto the voice of him who has all a power , who is from everlasting to everlasting , even b Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end .
3 But verily I say unto you , that it is not needful for this whole company of mine elders to be moving swiftly upon the waters , whilst the inhabitants on either side are perishing in unbelief .
5 For I , the Lord , have decreed in mine anger many destructions upon the waters ; yea , and especially upon these waters .
6 Nevertheless , all flesh is in mine hand , and he that is faithful among you shall not a perish by the waters .
7 Wherefore , it is expedient that my servant Sidney Gilbert and my servant a William W. Phelps be in haste upon their errand and mission .
9 But now , verily I say , it behooveth me that ye should part .
10 And inasmuch as they are a faithful they shall be preserved , and I , the Lord , will be b with them .
11 And let the residue take that which is needful for clothing .
12 Let my servant Sidney Gilbert take that which is not needful with him , as you shall agree .
13 And now , behold , for your a good I gave unto you a b commandment concerning these things ; and I , the Lord , will reason with you as with men in days of old .
14 Behold , I , the Lord , in the beginning blessed the a waters ; but in the last days , by the mouth of my servant John , I b cursed the waters .
15 Wherefore , the days will come that no flesh shall be safe upon the waters .
16 And it shall be said in days to come that none is able to go up to the land of Zion upon the waters , but he that is upright in heart .
17 And , as I , the Lord , in the beginning a cursed the land , even so in the last days have I b blessed it , in its time , for the use of my saints , that they may partake the fatness thereof .
19 I , the Lord , have decreed , and the destroyer rideth upon the face thereof , and I revoke not the decree .
20 I , the Lord , was a angry with you yesterday , but today mine anger is turned away .
21 Wherefore , let those concerning whom I have spoken , that should take their journey in haste — again I say unto you , let them take their journey in haste .
22 And it mattereth not unto me , after a little , if it so be that they fill their mission , whether they go by water or by land ; let this be as it is made known unto them a according to their judgments hereafter .
23 And now , concerning my servants , Sidney Rigdon , Joseph Smith , Jun . , and Oliver Cowdery , let them come not again upon the waters , save it be upon the canal , while journeying unto their homes ; or in other words they shall not come upon the waters to journey , save upon the canal .
25 And they shall do a like unto the children of Israel , b pitching their tents by the way .
26 And , behold , this commandment you shall give unto all your brethren .
28 Wherefore , let him do as the Spirit of the living God commandeth him , whether upon the land or upon the waters , as it remaineth with me to do hereafter .
29 And unto you is given the course for the saints , or the way for the saints of the camp of the Lord , to journey .
31 And in that place they shall lift up their voices unto God against that people , yea , unto him whose anger is a kindled against their wickedness , a people who are well ##AT##-##AT## nigh b ripened for destruction .
32 And from thence let them journey for the congregations of their brethren , for their labors even now are wanted more abundantly among them than among the congregations of the wicked .
34 And inasmuch as they do this they shall a rid their garments , and they shall be spotless before me .
35 And let them journey together , or a two by two , as seemeth them good , only let my servant Reynolds Cahoon , and my servant Samuel H. Smith , with whom I am well pleased , be not separated until they return to their homes , and this for a wise purpose in me .
37 And inasmuch as you have humbled yourselves before me , the blessings of the a kingdom are yours .
38 Gird up your loins and be a watchful and be sober , looking forth for the coming of the Son of Man , for he cometh in an hour you think not .
39 Pray always that you enter not into a temptation , that you may abide the day of his coming , whether in life or in death .
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , at Hiram , Ohio , November 1831 , at the request of Orson Hyde , Luke S. Johnson , Lyman E. Johnson , and William E. McLellin . HC 1 : 227 – 229 .
Although this revelation was given in response to supplication that the mind of the Lord be made known concerning the elders named , much of the content pertains to the whole Church .
1 My servant , Orson Hyde , was called by his ordination to proclaim the a everlasting gospel , by the b Spirit of the living God , from people to people , and from land to land , in the c congregations of the wicked , in their d synagogues , reasoning with and e expounding all scriptures unto them .
3 And this is the a ensample unto them , that they shall b speak as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost .
4 And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the a Holy Ghost shall be scripture , shall be the will of the Lord , shall be the mind of the Lord , shall be the word of the Lord , shall be the voice of the Lord , and the b power of God unto salvation .
5 Behold , this is the promise of the Lord unto you , O ye my servants .
6 Wherefore , be of good a cheer , and do not b fear , for I the Lord am with you , and will stand by you ; and ye shall bear record of me , even Jesus Christ , that I am the Son of the living God , that I c was , that I am , and that I am to come .
8 a Go ye into all the world , b preach the gospel to every c creature , acting in the d authority which I have given you , e baptizing in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost .
9 And a he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved , and he that believeth not shall be b damned .
10 And he that believeth shall be blest with a signs following , even as it is written .
12 And of as many as the Father shall bear record , to you shall be given power to a seal them up unto eternal life .
15 Wherefore they shall be a high priests who are worthy , and they shall be appointed by the b First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood , except they be literal descendants of c Aaron .
17 For the firstborn holds the right of the presidency over this priesthood , and the a keys or authority of the same .
18 No man has a legal right to this office , to hold the keys of this priesthood , except he be a a literal descendant and the firstborn of Aaron .
19 But , as a a high priest of the Melchizedek Priesthood has authority to officiate in all the lesser offices he may officiate in the office of b bishop when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found , provided he is called and set apart and ordained unto this power , under the hands of the First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood .
20 And a literal descendant of Aaron , also , must be designated by this Presidency , and found worthy , and a anointed , and ordained under the hands of this Presidency , otherwise they are not legally authorized to officiate in their priesthood .
21 But , by virtue of the decree concerning their right of the priesthood descending from father to son , they may claim their a anointing if at any time they can prove their lineage , or do ascertain it by revelation from the Lord under the b hands of the above named Presidency .
24 And if he repent he shall be a forgiven , according to the covenants and b commandments of the church .
25 And again , inasmuch as a parents have children in Zion , or in any of her b stakes which are organized , that c teach them not to understand the d doctrine of repentance , faith in Christ the Son of the living God , and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands , when e eight years old , the f sin be upon the heads of the parents .
26 For this shall be a law unto the a inhabitants of Zion , or in any of her stakes which are organized .
27 And their children shall be a baptized for the b remission of their sins when c eight years old , and receive the laying on of the hands .
28 And they shall also a teach their children to pray , and to walk uprightly before the Lord .
29 And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the a Sabbath day to keep it holy .
30 And the inhabitants of Zion also shall remember their a labors , inasmuch as they are appointed to labor , in all faithfulness ; for the b idler shall be had in remembrance before the Lord .
31 Now , I , the Lord , am not well a pleased with the inhabitants of Zion , for there are b idlers among them ; and their c children are also growing up in d wickedness ; they also e seek not earnestly the riches of eternity , but their eyes are full of f greediness .
32 These things ought not to be , and must be done away from among them ; wherefore , let my servant Oliver Cowdery a carry these sayings unto the land of Zion .
33 And a commandment I give unto them — that he that observeth not his a prayers before the Lord in the season thereof , let him be had in b remembrance before the judge of my people .
34 These sayings are a true and faithful ; wherefore , transgress them not , neither b take therefrom .
35 Behold , I am a Alpha and Omega , and I b come quickly .

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery , at Harmony , Pennsylvania , April 1829 .
HC 1 : 37 – 38 . Oliver is admonished to be patient , and is urged to be content to write , for the time being , at the dictation of the translator , rather than to attempt to translate .
1 – 6 , Other ancient records are yet to be translated ; 7 – 14 , The Book of Mormon is translated by study and by spiritual confirmation .
1 Behold , I say unto you , my son , that because you did not a translate according to that which you desired of me , and did commence again to b write for my servant , Joseph Smith , Jun . , even so I would that ye should continue until you have finished this record , which I have entrusted unto him .
2 And then , behold , a other b records have I , that I will give unto you power that you may assist to c translate .
3 Be patient , my son , for it is a wisdom in me , and it is not expedient that you should translate at this present time .
4 Behold , the work which you are called to do is to a write for my servant Joseph .
5 And , behold , it is because that you did not continue as you commenced , when you began to translate , that I have taken away this privilege from you .
6 Do not a murmur , my son , for it is wisdom in me that I have dealt with you after this manner .
7 Behold , you have not understood ; you have supposed that I would give it unto you , when you took no thought save it was to ask me .
8 But , behold , I say unto you , that you must a study it out in your b mind ; then you must c ask me if it be right , and if it is right I will cause that your d bosom shall e burn within you ; therefore , you shall f feel that it is right .
9 But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings , but you shall have a a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong ; therefore , you cannot write that which is b sacred save it be given you from me .
10 Now , if you had known this you could have a translated ; nevertheless , it is not expedient that you should translate now .
12 For , do you not behold that I have a given unto my servant b Joseph sufficient strength , whereby it is made up ?
And neither of you have I condemned .
13 Do this thing which I have commanded you , and you shall a prosper .
Be faithful , and yield to no b temptation .
14 Stand fast in the a work wherewith I have b called you , and a hair of your head shall not be lost , and you shall be c lifted up at the last day .
The words of his preaching unto his brethren .
He confoundeth a man who seeketh to overthrow the doctrine of Christ .
A few words concerning the history of the people of Nephi .
Jacob and Joseph seek to persuade men to believe in Christ and keep his commandments — Nephi dies — Wickedness prevails among the Nephites .
1 For behold , it came to pass that ##STAR## fifty and five years had passed away from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem ; wherefore , Nephi gave me , Jacob , a a commandment concerning the b small plates , upon which these things are engraven .
2 And he gave me , Jacob , a commandment that I should a write upon b these plates a few of the things which I considered to be most precious ; that I should not touch , save it were lightly , concerning the history of this people which are called the people of Nephi .
3 For he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon his a other plates , and that I should b preserve these plates and hand them down unto my seed , from generation to generation .
4 And if there were preaching which was a sacred , or revelation which was great , or prophesying , that I should engraven the b heads of them upon these plates , and touch upon them as much as it were possible , for Christ ’ s sake , and for the sake of our people .
5 For because of faith and great anxiety , it truly had been made manifest unto us concerning our people , what things should a happen unto them .
6 And we also had many revelations , and the spirit of much prophecy ; wherefore , we knew of a Christ and his kingdom , which should come .
7 Wherefore we labored diligently among our people , that we might persuade them to a come unto Christ , and partake of the goodness of God , that they might enter into his b rest , lest by any means he should swear in his wrath they should not c enter in , as in the d provocation in the days of temptation while the children of Israel were in the e wilderness .
8 Wherefore , we would to God that we could persuade all men a not to rebel against God , to b provoke him to anger , but that all men would believe in Christ , and view his death , and suffer his c cross and bear the shame of the world ; wherefore , I , Jacob , take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi .
9 Now Nephi began to be old , and he saw that he must soon a die ; wherefore , he b anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his people now , according to the reigns of the c kings .
11 Wherefore , the people were desirous to retain in remembrance his name .
And whoso should reign in his stead were called by the people , second Nephi , third Nephi , and so forth , according to the reigns of the kings ; and thus they were called by the people , let them be of whatever name they would .
12 And it came to pass that Nephi died .
13 Now the people which were not a Lamanites were Nephites ; nevertheless , they were called Nephites , Jacobites , Josephites , b Zoramites , Lamanites , Lemuelites , and Ishmaelites .
14 But I , Jacob , shall not hereafter distinguish a them by these names , but I shall b call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of Nephi , and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call c Nephites , or the d people of Nephi , according to the reigns of the kings .
15 And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi , under the reign of the second king , began to grow hard in their hearts , and indulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices , such as like unto David of old desiring many a wives and b concubines , and also Solomon , his son .
16 Yea , and they also began to search much a gold and silver , and began to be lifted up somewhat in pride .
17 Wherefore I , Jacob , gave unto them these words as I taught them in the a temple , having first obtained mine b errand from the Lord .
18 For I , Jacob , and my brother Joseph had been a consecrated priests and b teachers of this people , by the hand of Nephi .
19 And we did a magnify our office unto the Lord , taking upon us the b responsibility , answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not c teach them the word of God with all diligence ; wherefore , by laboring with our might their d blood might not come upon our garments ; otherwise their blood would come upon our garments , and we would not be found spotless at the last day .

Chessboxers go through alternating four ##AT##-##AT## minute long rounds of chess and three ##AT##-##AT## minute boxing rounds with a one ##AT##-##AT## minute break in between .
A maximum total of 11 rounds are fought out — six rounds of chess and five rounds of boxing . The fight begins with a round of chess .
Each player has a respite of 12 minutes during the game of chess , which means the maximum duration of the whole chess game is 24 minutes .
A K.O. or checkmate can lead to an early win , and the fight can also be cut short if a player exceeds the chess time limit or the referee decides the fight has to be aborted .
If the game of chess ends with a tie , it is settled with the points earned in the boxing rounds .
If the boxing fight ends with a tie , the player who had black on the chessboard wins .
- Chess and boxing … how does that go together ?
Chessboxing is the ultimate challenge for both the body and the mind .
More and more contemporary athletic disciplines are characterised by multifaceted challenges .
It ’ s comparable to a biathlon , as one example .
Extreme physical stress is combined with a huge mental challenge .
Chessboxing is a bit more radical than a biathlon , but through targeted training , the body can be prepared for matches just as well as it can for a biathlon .
The alteration between boxing and playing chess represents the biggest challenge .
- When was the first ##AT##-##AT## ever chessboxing fight and when was the WCBO founded ?
The first official chessboxing fight ever to be held was the Middleweight World Championship between Iepe the Joker and Luis the Lawyer on the 14th of November 2003 at the Paradiso in Amsterdam .
Iepe the Joker won the match after a dramatic fight in the 11th and last round when Luis the Lawyer exceeded his time limit in chess .
Shortly before this championship , the WCBO was founded .
- What is the goal of the WCBO ?
Our primary objective is the official dissemination of chessboxing as a self ##AT##-##AT## contained , internationally recognised athletic discipline .
The cornerstone for out goal has been laid with the founding of the first Chess Boxing Club of Berlin . In addition , we also support initiatives for starting chessboxing clubs nationwide and abroad .
- What does the WCBO ’ s slogan mean — “ Fighting is done in the ring and wars are waged on the board ” ?
With this slogan , we ’ re trying to promote aggression management .
Fighting is simply done in the ring where certain fairness rules apply and where there ’ s a referee .
Wars should be waged on the board , not in reality .
- How did the idea of chessboxing come about ?
The idea originates from the comic Le froid eqateur ( literally ‘ cold equator ’ ) by Enki Bilal .
Chessboxing was initially conceived by the Dutch artist IEPE as an artistic performance in which the themes of a healthy spirit in a healthy body and aggression management played a role .
After just a short period of time , an opportunity arose to further develop the chessboxing concept into a serious sport in collaboration with experts from Berlin and the Dutch chess and boxing federation .
- What would the ultimate chessboxing fight be like ?
In an ESPN interview , Lennox Lewis already expressed some interest and prior to the legendary Heavyweight World Championship in Los Angeles in 2005 , Vitali Klitschko offered to play a game of chess with Lennox Lewis before they entered the ring .
- How many fights does the WCBO hold each year ?
The WCBO aims at holding three to four championship fights each year .

If you were told that en is a Spanish preposition and were asked what it means , you most likely would guess &quot; in &quot; or &quot; on .
&quot; And you &apos;d be right — in both cases . But en can also be translated as &quot; at , &quot; &quot; about , &quot; &quot; by , &quot; &quot; on top of , &quot; &quot; upon , &quot; &quot; inside of &quot; and other ways , so its use isn &apos;t as straightforward as it may appear .
Fortunately , when en doesn &apos;t mean &quot; on &quot; or &quot; in , &quot; you can usually tell by the context what is meant .
Like some other prepositions , en can seem quite versatile to the foreigner .
Indicating location and meaning &quot; in &quot; : El dinero está en la caja . The money is in the box .
I live in Spain . ( Note : &quot; In &quot; meaning &quot; inside of &quot; also can be expressed by dentro de .
Indicating location and meaning &quot; on &quot; : El dinero está en la mesa . The money is on the table .
He put the posters on the wall . ( Note : The preposition a alternatively could have been used in the second sentence .
To express a value : Vendió el carro en $ 2.000 . He sold the car for $ 2,000 .
( Note : The preposition por alternatively could have been used in the previous sentence . Vendió el carro por $ 2.000 .
With certain verbs to mean &quot; in &quot; or &quot; on &quot; : Competer en , to compete in ; concentrarse en , to concentrate on ; concurrir en , to concur in ; confiar en , to trust in ; creer en , to believe in ; empeñarse en , to persist in ; esperar en , to trust in ; insistir en , to insist on ; intervenir en , to participate in ; persistir en , to persist in ; reflejar en , to reflect on ; resultar en , to result in .
As a beginner , you don &apos;t need to memorize all the phrases and verbs that use en ; of the verb phrases , pensar en ( to think about ) is the most common one that causes beginners difficulty .
But you should be aware of those uses , so you know that en might not mean &quot; in &quot; or &quot; on .

By including the most important updates for Windows 2000 , Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 may help customers make Windows 2000 ##AT##-##AT## based computers more secure .
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 also makes it easier for customers to build new deployment images .
This update rollup requires less predeployment testing , because the number of updates that are included in this update rollup is smaller than the number of updates that are typically included in a service pack .
Most customers installed current versions of many of the files when older updates were installed .
Additionally , Microsoft has already released most of the contents of this update rollup as individual updates and hotfixes .
Individual hotfixes that are not included in this update rollup will be available as individual downloads .
Because Microsoft believes that Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 meets the needs of customers better than a new service pack for Windows 2000 , Microsoft will not release another service pack for Windows 2000 .
Therefore , Windows 2000 SP4 is the final service pack for Windows 2000 .
Customers who have not yet installed Windows 2000 SP4 should consider installing Windows 2000 SP4 as soon as possible .
Windows 2000 with SP4 is a prerequisite for Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 .
Q1 : Why does Microsoft believe that Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 meets the needs of customers better than a new service pack for Windows 2000 ?
A1 : Microsoft talked to many customers about their plans for maintaining their Windows 2000 deployments .
The most frequent requests were for Microsoft to make keeping Windows 2000 ##AT##-##AT## based computers up to date as easy as possible , and for Microsoft to reduce the predeployment testing that customers have to perform .
Update rollups may help customers make their computers more secure .
Update rollups also help customers build new system images without applying and tracking individual hotfixes .
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 requires less predeployment testing because the number of updates that are included in the update rollup is smaller than the number of updates that are typically included in a service pack .
Because Windows 2000 is a mature product , many of the Windows 2000 hotfixes that were released after the release of Windows 2000 SP4 address relatively obscure problems .
These problems affect a small number of customers .
At this point , an update rollup provides the most usefulness at the least risk of instability .
Q2 : How will Microsoft list Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 on the Windows Update Web site ?
A2 : Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 is listed as a high ##AT##-##AT## priority update in the &quot; Critical and Service Packs &quot; category on the Windows Update Web site .
During the next few months , Windows Update will transition Windows 2000 customers to a new version of Windows Update .
After this transition , Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 will be listed in the &quot; High Priority Updates &quot; category .
Q3 : Should I install Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 even if I have kept my Windows 2000 SP4 systems up to date ?
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 contains important fixes that have not previously been part of individual security updates .
Additionally , this update rollup contains enhancements that may help increase system security , increase reliability , reduce support costs , and support the current generation of PC hardware .
To address minor compatibility problems that were introduced by earlier security updates , hotfixes may have updated some files that were installed by the earlier updates .
This update includes the latest versions of these files .
Therefore , even if a system is fully up to date , Windows Update still detects and installs this update rollup .
Customers who use managed security update deployment solutions should decide whether to deploy Update Rollup 1 within their infrastructure .
Q4 : Will Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 be distributed over Automatic Updates ?
A4 : At first , this update rollup will not be distributed over Automatic Updates .
This delay is because of the transition from the Windows Update version 4 infrastructure to the version 6 infrastructure .
This update rollup will be made available as an automatic update in September , 2005 .
Q5 : Will there be an administrative blocking tool for Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 like there was for Windows XP SP2 ?
A5 : No , Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 is not a service pack .
Therefore , this update rollup does not require the same level of deployment control .
This update rollup is treated like other security or reliability updates .
These updates are typically distributed by Windows Update and by Automatic Updates .
Q6 : Do I have to install the individual security bulletin updates before I install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 on new installations of Windows 2000 ?
First install Windows 2000 SP4 , and then install the update rollup .
After you install the update rollup , run Windows Update to find updates that were released after April 30 , 2005 , or that were not included in the update rollup .
Q7 : Are customers required to install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 ?
A7 : Customers are not required to install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 .
Microsoft designed the update rollup to make it easy to keep Windows 2000 ##AT##-##AT## based computers up to date .
Therefore , we strongly recommend that customers install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 as soon as they can .
Q8 : After Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 is installed on a computer that is running Windows 2000 SP4 , will the service pack level of Windows 2000 change ?
The service pack level of the computer remains at Windows 2000 SP4 .
After you install Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 , the computer will be up to date from a life ##AT##-##AT## cycle policy perspective until the end ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## life date for Windows 2000 .
The end ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## life date for Windows 2000 will be no sooner than January 1 , 2010 .
Q9 : Is this the first time that Microsoft has produced an update rollup instead of a service pack ?
Microsoft has produced update rollups before .
Q10 : If Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 offers significant benefits over a new service pack , why does Microsoft not always use update rollups instead of service packs ?
A10 : Service packs and update rollups play different , yet complimentary roles .
Service packs deliver important updates and new features that customers request before the next release of a major operating system .
Update rollups deliver a group of updates between more major releases .
Microsoft uses update rollups when there is a longer than typical gap between service pack releases .
Later in the life cycle of a product , update rollups make it easier for customers to keep their computers up to date .
When customers install an update rollup , customers do not have to individually install all the updates that are available for a product .
Q11 : How does Microsoft decide which hotfixes to include in an update rollup ?
A11 : Microsoft examines the number of times that customers request and download each hotfix from Microsoft Web sites and from Product Support .
Microsoft also evaluates the potential cost savings for customers .
This evaluation is based on experience in the Windows 2000 data center environment at Microsoft .
Q12 : What kinds of updates are included in Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 ?
A12 : Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 contains all the security updates that were produced for Windows 2000 after the release of SP4 until April 30 , 2005 .
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 also contains a small number of important non ##AT##-##AT## security updates .
For example , Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 contains updates to address problems that are time ##AT##-##AT## consuming for support professionals to troubleshoot and fix .
Q13 : What specific updates and hotfixes are included in Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 ?
A13 : The following table lists all the updates and hotfixes that are included in Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 .
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 changes how telephony server and client computers communicate using the Telephony Application Programming Interface ( TAPI ) .
After you install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 , a Windows 2000 telephony client accepts only encrypted RPC packets from a telephony server .
The client does not communicate with a telephony server that sends non ##AT##-##AT## encrypted RPC packets .
However , this restriction does not apply to TAPI deployments where the client computers are using mailslot instead of remote procedure call ( RPC ) for communications with the telephony server .
This restriction also does not apply where the telephony server uses mailslot for communications .
By default , a Windows 2000 client uses mailslot to communicate with the telephony server .
A Windows 2000 client uses RPC only when the client is explicitly configured as connection ##AT##-##AT## oriented .
To configure the client this way , use the tcmsetup command together with the -x switch .
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 does not contain updates for Windows components that are not included with a clean slipstream install of Windows 2000 SP4 .
If components were previously installed or updated , you must download individual security updates by using Windows Update .
The Microsoft VM is not included in SP4 natively .
However the VM may be resident on systems which were updated to SP4 from a prior SP or installed by a third party software package .
Windows 2000 originally included Internet Explorer 5.01 .
Service packs for Windows 2000 only affect this version .
We recommend that you install Internet Explorer 6 SP1 and the current cumulative Internet Explorer security updates on Windows 2000 computers .
After you apply Microsoft Windows 2000 Update Rollup 1 , you may receive an error message when you try to print .

Information as a concept has a diversity of meanings , from everyday usage to technical settings .
Generally speaking , the concept of information is closely related to notions of constraint , communication , control , data , form , instruction , knowledge , meaning , mental stimulus , pattern , perception , and representation .
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the first known historical meaning of the word information in English was the act of informing , or giving form or shape to the mind , as in education , instruction , or training . A quote from 1387 English text : &quot; Five books come down from heaven for information of mankind .
a particular instruction . &quot; Melibee had heard the great skills and reasons of Dame Prudence , and her wise information and techniques .
The English word was apparently derived from the Latin accusative form ( informationem ) of the nominative ( informatio ) : this noun is on its turn derived from the verb &quot; informare &quot; ( to inform ) in the sense of &quot; to give form to the mind &quot; , &quot; to discipline &quot; , &quot; instruct &quot; , &quot; teach &quot; : &quot; Men so wise should go and inform their kings .
&quot; ( 1330 ) Inform itself comes ( via French ) from the Latin verb informare , to give form to , to form an idea of .
Furthermore , Latin itself already even contained the word informatio meaning concept or idea , but the extent to which this may have influenced the development of the word information in English is unclear .
As a final note , the ancient Greek word for form was &quot; μορφή &quot; ( morf - &gt; morphe , Morph ) and also είδος eidos ( kind , idea , shape , set ) , the latter word was famously used in a technical philosophical sense by Plato ( and later Aristotle ) to denote the ideal identity or essence of something ( see Theory of forms ) .
&quot; Eidos &quot; can also be associated with thought , proposition or even concept .
Information is a term with many meanings depending on context , but is as a rule closely related to such concepts as meaning , knowledge , instruction , communication , representation , and mental stimulus . Simply stated , information is a message received and understood .
There are many other aspects of information since it is the knowledge acquired through study or experience or instruction . But overall , information is the result of processing , manipulating and organizing data in a way that adds to the knowledge of the person receiving it .
Information is the state of a system of interest . Message is the information materialized .
Information is always about something ( size of a parameter , occurrence of an event , value , ethics , etc ) . Viewed in this manner , information does not have to be accurate ; it may be a truth or a lie , or just the sound of a falling tree .
Even a disruptive noise used to inhibit the flow of communication and create misunderstanding would in this view be a form of information . However , generally speaking , if the amount of information in the received message increases , the message is more accurate .
An important variation identifies information as that which would be communicated by a message if it were sent from a sender to a receiver capable of understanding the message . In another variation , it is not required that the sender be capable of understanding the message , or even cognizant that there is a message , making information something that can be extracted from an environment , e.g. , through observation , reading or measurement .
Communication theory provides a numerical measure of the uncertainty of an outcome . For example , we can say that &quot; the signal contained thousands of bits of information &quot; .
This is used in application of statistics to estimation theory and to science in general . Fisher information is thought of as the amount of information that a message carries about an unobservable parameter .
For example , with a normal likelihood function , the Fisher information is the reciprocal of the variance of the law . In the absence of knowledge of the likelihood law , the Fisher information may be computed from normally distributed score data as the reciprocal of their second moment .
The view of information as a message came into prominence with the publication in 1948 of an influential paper by Claude Shannon , &quot; A Mathematical Theory of Communication .
&quot; This thesis provides the foundations of information theory and endows the word information not only with a technical meaning but also a measure .
If the sending device is equally likely to send any one of a set of N messages , then the preferred measure of &quot; the information produced when one message is chosen from the set &quot; is the base two logarithm of N ( This measure is called self ##AT##-##AT## information ) .
It is important to recognize the limitations of traditional information theory and algorithmic information theory from the perspective of human meaning .
For example , when referring to the meaning content of a message Shannon noted “ Frequently the messages have meaning … these semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem .
The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages ” ( emphasis in original ) .
In information theory signals are part of a process , not a substance ; they do something , they do not contain any specific meaning . Combining algorithmic information theory and information theory we can conclude that the most random signal contains the most information as it can be interpreted in any way and cannot be compressed .
Michael Reddy noted that &quot; &apos; signals &apos; of the mathematical theory are &apos; patterns that can be exchanged &apos; .
There is no message contained in the signal , the signals convey the ability to select from a set of possible messages .
&quot; In information theory &quot; the system must be designed to operate for each possible selection , not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design &quot; .
Information can be defined as a pattern , a combination of qualities that form a characteristic arrangement . This view assumes neither accuracy nor directly communicating parties , but instead assumes a separation between an object and its representation .
What are commonly referred to as data in computing , statistics , and other fields , are forms of information in this sense . The electro ##AT##-##AT## magnetic patterns in a computer network and connected devices are related to something other than the pattern itself , such as text characters to be displayed and keyboard input .
On the other hand , according to semiotics , data is symbols with certain syntax and information is data with a certain semantic . Painting and drawing contain information to the extent that they represent something such as an assortment of objects on a table , a profile , or a landscape .
But if information can be defined merely as a pattern , does that mean that neither utility nor meaning are necessary components of information ?
Arguably a distinction must be made between raw unprocessed data and information which possesses utility , value or some quantum of meaning .
On this view , information may indeed be characterized as a pattern ; but this is a necessary condition , not a sufficient one .
When one interprets representation , one can predict a broader pattern from a limited number of observations ( inference ) or understand the relation between patterns of two different things ( decoding ) . One example of the former is to sip a soup to know if it is spoiled ; an example of the latter is examining footprints to determine the animal and its condition .
In his book Sensory Ecology , Dusenbery called these causal inputs . Other inputs ( information ) are important only because they are associated with causal inputs and can be used to predict the occurrence of a causal input at a later time ( and perhaps another place ) .
Some information is important because of association with other information but eventually there must be a connection to a causal input .
In practice , information is usually carried by weak stimuli that must be detected by specialized sensory systems and amplified by energy inputs before they can be functional to the organism or device .
For example , light is often a causal input to plants but provides information to animals . The colored light reflected from a flower is too weak to do much photosynthetic work but the visual system of the bee detects it and the bee &apos;s nervous system uses the information to guide the bee to the flower , where the bee often finds nectar or pollen , which are causal inputs , serving a nutritional function .
Information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns . In this sense , there is no need for a conscious mind to perceive , much less appreciate , the pattern .
Consider , for example , DNA . The sequence of nucleotides is a pattern that influences the formation and development of an organism without any need for a conscious mind .
Systems theory at times seems to refer to information in this sense , assuming information does not necessarily involve any conscious mind , and patterns circulating ( due to feedback ) in the system can be called information .
In other words , it can be said that information in this sense is something potentially perceived as representation , though not created or presented for that purpose .
If , however , the premise of &quot; influence &quot; implies that information has been perceived by a conscious mind and also interpreted by it , the specific context associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information into knowledge .
Stewart ( 2001 ) argues that the transformation of information into knowledge is a critical one , lying at the core of value creation and competitive advantage for the modern enterprise .
In 2003 , J. D. Bekenstein claimed there is a growing trend in physics to define the physical world as being made of information itself ( and thus information is defined in this way ) ( see Digital physics ) .
Information has a well defined meaning in physics . Examples of this include the phenomenon of quantum entanglement where particles can interact without reference to their separation or the speed of light .
Information itself cannot travel faster than light even if the information is transmitted indirectly . This could lead to the fact that all attempts at physically observing a particle with an &quot; entangled &quot; relationship to another are slowed down , even though the particles are not connected in any other way other than by the information they carry .
Another link is demonstrated by the Maxwell &apos;s demon thought experiment .
In this experiment , a direct relationship between information and another physical property , entropy , is demonstrated .
A consequence is that it is impossible to destroy information without increasing the entropy of a system ; in practical terms this often means generating heat .
Another , more philosophical , outcome is that information could be thought of as interchangeable with energy .
Thus , in the study of logic gates , the theoretical lower bound of thermal energy released by an AND gate is higher than for the NOT gate ( because information is destroyed in an AND gate and simply converted in a NOT gate ) .
Physical information is of particular importance in the theory of quantum computers .
Records are a specialized form of information .
Essentially , records are information produced consciously or as by ##AT##-##AT## products of business activities or transactions and retained because of their value .
Primarily their value is as evidence of the activities of the organization but they may also be retained for their informational value .
Sound records management ensures that the integrity of records is preserved for as long as they are required .
Records may be maintained to retain corporate memory of the organization or to meet legal , fiscal or accountability requirements imposed on the organization .
Willis ( 2005 ) expressed the view that sound management of business records and information delivered &quot; … six key requirements for good corporate governance … transparency ; accountability ; due process ; compliance ; meeting statutory and common law requirements ; and security of personal and corporate information .
Beynon ##AT##-##AT## Davies &#91; 2 &#93; explains the multi ##AT##-##AT## faceted concept of information in terms of that of signs and sign ##AT##-##AT## systems . Signs themselves can be considered in terms of four inter ##AT##-##AT## dependent levels , layers or branches of semiotics : pragmatics , semantics , syntax , and empirics .
Pragmatics is concerned with the purpose of communication . Pragmatics links the issue of signs with that of intention .
The focus of pragmatics is on the intentions of human agents underlying communicative behaviour . In other words , intentions link language to action .

Los Angeles was founded September 4 , 1781 , by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve as El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Angeles del Río de Porciúncula ( The Village of Our Lady , the Queen of the Angels of the river of Porziuncola ) .
&#91; 5 &#93; It became a part of Mexico in 1821 , following its independence from Spain . In 1848 , at the end of the Mexican ##AT##-##AT## American War , Los Angeles and California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , thereby becoming part of the United States ; Mexico retained the territory of Baja California .
Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4 , 1850 , five months before California achieved statehood .
Los Angeles is one of the world &apos;s centers of business , international trade , entertainment , culture , media , fashion , science , technology , and education .
It is home to renowned institutions covering a broad range of professional and cultural fields , and is one of the most substantial economic engines within the United States .
As the home base of Hollywood , it is known as the &quot; Entertainment Capital of the World &quot; , leading the world in the creation of motion pictures , television production and recorded music . The importance of the entertainment business to the city has led many celebrities to call Los Angeles and its surrounding suburbs home .
The Los Angeles coastal area was first settled by the Tongva ( or Gabrieleños ) and Chumash Native American tribes thousands of years ago . The first Europeans arrived in 1542 in an expedition organized by the viceroy of New Spain and commanded by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo , a Portuguese ##AT##-##AT## born explorer who claimed the area of southern California for the Spanish Empire .
In 1771 , Franciscan friar Junípero Serra built the Mission San Gabriel Arcangel near Whittier Narrows , in what is now called San Gabriel Valley . &#91; 8 &#93; In 1777 , the new governor of California , Felipe de Neve , recommended to Antonio María de Bucareli y Ursúa , viceroy of New Spain , that the site noted by Juan Crespí be developed into a pueblo .
Tradition has it that on this day they were escorted by four Spanish colonial soldiers , two priests from the Mission and Governor de Neve . The town was named El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles del Río de Porciúncula ( The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels on the Porciúncula River ) .
Railroads arrived when the Southern Pacific completed its line to Los Angeles in 1876 .
&#91; 13 &#93; Oil was discovered in 1892 , and by 1923 Los Angeles was producing one ##AT##-##AT## quarter of the world &apos;s petroleum .
By 1900 , the population had grown to more than 102,000 people , &#91; 15 &#93; putting pressure on the city &apos;s water supply .
&#91; 16 &#93; 1913 &apos;s completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct , under the supervision of William Mulholland , assured the continued growth of the city .
In the 1920s , the motion picture and aviation industries flocked to Los Angeles .
In 1932 , with population surpassing one million , &#91; 17 &#93; the city hosted the Summer Olympics .
Also in the 1980s , Los Angeles became the center of the heavy metal music scene , especially glam metal bands . &#91; 20 &#93; In 1984 , the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time .
Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries , the 1984 Olympics became the most financially successful in history , and only the second Olympics to turn a profit – the other being the 1932 Summer Olympics , also held in Los Angeles .
During the remaining decades of the 20th century , the city was plagued by increasing gang warfare , drug trades , and police corruption .
Racial tensions erupted again in 1992 with the Rodney King controversy and the large ##AT##-##AT## scale riots that followed the acquittal of his police attackers .
Voters defeated efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede from the city in 2002 .
Gentrification and urban redevelopment have occurred in many parts of the city , most notably Hollywood , Koreatown , Silver Lake , Echo Park and Downtown .
Los Angeles is irregularly shaped and covers a total area of 498.3 square miles ( 1,291 km2 ) , comprising 469.1 square miles ( 1,214.9 km2 ) of land and 29.2 square miles ( 75.7 km2 ) of water .
The city extends for 44 miles ( 71 km ) longitudinally and for 29 miles ( 47 km ) latitudinally . The perimeter of the city is 342 miles ( 550 km ) .
The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens , also called Sister Elsie Peak .
&#91; 24 &#93; Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley , it reaches a height of 5,080 ft ( 1,548 m ) . The major river is the Los Angeles River , which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal .
The period of May through October is warm to hot and dry with average high temperatures of 74 - 84 ° F ( 24 - 29 ° C ) and lows of 58 - 66 ° F ( 14 - 19 ° C ) , however temperatures frequently exceed 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) and occasionally reach 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) in inland areas ( away from the moderating effect of the ocean ) .
The period of November through April is mild and somewhat rainy with average high temperatures of 68 - 73 ° F ( 20 - 23 ° C ) and lows of 48 - 53 ° F ( 9 - 12 ° C ) , but temperatures could occasionally drop to low 40s ( ~ 5 ° C ) or be as high as 80 ° F ( 26 ° C ) for few days during winter .
The Los Angeles area is also subject to the phenomenon typical of a microclimate .
As such , the temperatures can vary as much as 18 ° F ( 10 ° C ) between inland areas and the coast , with a temperature gradient of over one degree per mile ( 1.6 km ) from the coast inland .
California has also a weather phenomenon called &quot; June Gloom or May Grey &quot; , which sometimes gives overcast or foggy skies in the morning at the coast , but usually gives sunny skies by noon , during late spring and early summer .
Los Angeles averages 15 inches ( 385 mm ) of precipitation annually , which mainly occurs during the winter and spring ( November thru April ) with generally light rain showers , but sometimes as heavy rainfall and thunderstorms .
The coast gets slightly less rainfall , while the mountains get slightly more .
Years of average rainfall are rare ; the usual pattern is bimodal , with a short string of dry years ( perhaps 7 ##AT##-##AT## 8 inches / 175 ##AT##-##AT## 200 mm ) followed by one or two wet years that make up the average .
Snowfall is extremely rare in the city basin , but the mountains within city limits slopes typically receive snowfall every winter .
The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2 inches ( 5 cm ) in 1932 .
The name given by the Chumash tribe of Native Americans for the area now known as Los Angeles translates to &quot; the valley of smoke &quot; . &#91; 35 &#93; because of the smog from native campfires .
Owing to geography , heavy reliance on automobiles , and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex , Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog . The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion , which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles , airplanes , locomotives , shipping , manufacturing , and other sources .
&#91; 36 &#93; Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog , Los Angeles gets only 15 inches ( 381 mm ) of rain each year : pollution accumulates over many consecutive days . Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation , including the Clean Air Act .
More recently , the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emission vehicles .
As a result , pollution levels have dropped in recent decades . The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium .
Despite improvement , the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short ##AT##-##AT## term particle pollution and year ##AT##-##AT## round particle pollution .
&#91; 38 &#93; &#91; 39 &#93; In 2008 , the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year ##AT##-##AT## round particulate pollution . &#91; 40 &#93; In addition , the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel .
The city is divided into many neighborhoods , many of which were incorporated places or communities that were annexed by the city . There are also several independent cities around Los Angeles , but they are popularly grouped with the city of Los Angeles , either due to being completely engulfed as enclaves by Los Angeles , or lying within its immediate vicinity .

The city is the largest in the U.S. without an NFL team .
There was a time when Los Angeles boasted two NFL teams , the Rams and the Raiders .
Both left the city in 1995 , with the Rams moving to St. Louis and the Raiders heading back to Oakland .
Los Angeles is the second ##AT##-##AT## largest city and television market in the United States , but has no NFL team ( see List of television stations in North America by media market ) .
Since the franchise &apos;s departures the NFL as an organization , and individual NFL owners , have attempted to relocate a team to the city . Immediately following the 1995 NFL season , Seattle Seahawks owner Ken Behring went as far as packing up moving vans to start play in the Rose Bowl under a new team name and logo for the 1996 season .
&#91; 69 &#93; In 2003 , then NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue indicated L.A. would get a new expansion team , a thirty ##AT##-##AT## third franchise , after the choice of Houston over L.A. in the 2002 league expansion round . &#91; 70 &#93; When the New Orleans Saints were displaced from the Superdome by Hurricane Katrina media outlets reported the NFL was planning to move the team to Los Angeles permanently .

The city is governed by a mayor ##AT##-##AT## council system . The current mayor is Antonio Villaraigosa .
There are 15 city council districts . Other elected city officials include the City Attorney Carmen Trutanich and the City Controller Wendy Greuel .
The city attorney prosecutes misdemeanors within the city limits . The district attorney , elected by county voters , prosecutes misdemeanors in unincorporated areas and in 78 of the 88 cities in the county , as well as felonies throughout the county .
Voters created Neighborhood Councils in the Charter Reform of 1999 . First proposed by City Council member Joel Wachs in 1996 , they were designed to promote public participation in government and make it more responsive to local needs .
The councils cover districts which are not necessarily identical to the traditional neighborhoods of Los Angeles .
Almost ninety neighborhood councils ( NCs ) are certified and all &quot; stakeholders &quot; — meaning anyone who lives , works or owns property in a neighborhood — may vote for members of the councils &apos; governing bodies .
Some council bylaws allow other people with a stake in the community to cast ballots as well .
The councils are official government bodies and so their governing bodies and committees must abide by California &apos;s Brown Act , which governs the meetings of deliberative assemblies .
The first notable concern of the neighborhood councils collectively was the opposition by some of them in March 2004 to an 18 % increase in water rates by the city &apos;s Department of Water and Power .
This led the City Council to approve only a limited increase pending independent review .
More recently , some of the councils petitioned the City Council in summer 2006 to allow them to introduce ideas for legislative action , but the City Council put off a decision .
The neighborhood councils have been allocated $ 50,000 each for administration , outreach and approved neighborhood projects .
In May 2009 , the city council floated a measure to reduce the funding of the neighborhood councils to $ 11,200 each .

Los Angeles Unified School District serves almost all of the city of Los Angeles , as well as several surrounding communities , with a student population over 800,000 . &#91; 79 &#93; After Proposition 13 was approved in 1978 , urban school districts had considerable trouble with funding .
LAUSD has become known for its underfunded , overcrowded and poorly maintained campuses , although its 162 Magnet schools help compete with local private schools .
&#91; 80 &#93; Several small sections of Los Angeles are in the Las Virgenes Unified School District .
Los Angeles County Office of Education operates the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts . The Los Angeles Public Library system operates 72 public libraries in the city .
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and other agencies operate an extensive system of bus lines , as well as subway and light rail lines across Los Angeles County , with a combined daily ridership of 1.7 million . &#91; 82 &#93; The majority of this ( 1.4 million ) is taken up by the city &apos;s bus system , the second busiest in the country .
The subway and light rail combined average the remaining roughly 319,000 boardings per weekday . &#91; 83 &#93; Altogether , public transit ridership is much lower than many other large cities , with 12 % of Los Angeles commuters riding public transportation .
The city &apos;s subway system is the ninth busiest in the United States and its light rail system is the country &apos;s third busiest .
The rail system includes the Red and Purple subway lines , as well as the Gold , Blue , and Green light rail lines .
The Metro Rapid buses are a bus rapid transit program with stops and frequency similar those of a light rail .
The city is also central to the commuter rail system Metrolink which links Los Angeles to all neighboring counties as well as many suburbs .

It adjoins the separate Port of Long Beach .
The sea ports of the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach together make up the Los Angeles – Long Beach Harbor . There are also smaller , non ##AT##-##AT## industrial harbors along L.A. &apos; s coastline .
The port includes four bridges : the Vincent Thomas Bridge , Henry Ford Bridge , Gerald Desmond Bridge , and Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge .

It is open ; you can go in and out any time you want , right ? Right .
Until someone steps in , claims the door as his and tells you you have to pay to get in .
Oh , and he ( and everyone else ) still considers the door open , because you can see what &apos;s on the other side . See , open door , open formats !
Yeah . So , you probably know some open formats already : MP3 , OOXML , Xvid , H.264 and the rest of the MPEG ##AT##-##AT## 4 mess .
Because their specification is , in fact , open , which means you can implement it anywhere you want ... if you pay to cross the door .
Well , I guess you can &apos;t implement it afer all .
If freedom is catchy , as some people claim , then free formats would have taken over by now , wouldn &apos;t they ?
I too wish it was that simple .
Until recently , there wasn &apos;t an exact distinction between open and free formats , but such distinction is becoming more and more clear .
It &apos;s got to the point where the big corps are attacking free formats to protect their investments in the open ones .
As soon as word got out that Theora would be the baseline video codec of HTML 5 , a Nokia representative came out of nowhere and vaguely suggested that a submarine patent may be there somewhere .
Neither he or Nokia have expanded on this , nor will they .
The damage was already done , and Nokia &apos;s investments in 3GPP technology were not wasted .
They hadn &apos;t paid all that money in licenses , hardware optimizations and research to make MPEG ##AT##-##AT## 4 work on cellphones just to let an upstart that everyone else could implement win the race . No way , ese !
And you likely already know about the whole OOXML debacle . How Microsoft got so afraid of OpenDocument ( ODF ) that they invested millions and millions on a 6000 page pile of — let &apos;s face it — crap .
Pure , pointless crap . To beat another office format .
And they bribed every ISO jurisdiction they could .
To beat another office format . Because it would mean everyone would use a single format and make Microsoft &apos;s office suite obsolete .
This isn &apos;t anymore about closed vs. open formats , and you don &apos;t need me to rub it in your face .
It &apos;s time to leave those non ##AT##-##AT## free formats behind and look forward for a world of interoperability , a world of doors free to trespass in whatever way you want , and where no one will be able to take that freedom away from anyone else .
tl ; dr version : Just because something calls itself an open standard , it doesn &apos;t mean it should be trusted .

Spandau is the westernmost district ( Bezirk ) of the German capital city of Berlin , the town itself situated at the confluence of the Spree and Havel rivers .
Once a town in its own right , Spandau is one of the oldest areas in the Berlin region and still retains much of its own unique character , having been spared the worst of the Allied bombing in the Second World War that so devastated the rest of the city . The center of the town is formed by a dense network of medieval streets and a market square , still retaining a large number of timber ##AT##-##AT## framed buildings .
Maybe the sweetest little bed and breakfast place in Berlin . Outside the center in Spandau , close to lakes and rivers , to the Olympic Stadium and the convention center .

Bornholm &#91; 1 &#93; is Denmark &apos; s crown jewel . &apos; The Pearl of the Baltic &apos; has sandy beaches on the south of the island which are renowned for their Mediterranean light and feel .
Its forests impart a more rugged feel than found elsewhere in densly ##AT##-##AT## populated Denmark .
Though practically unknown to Americans , this island of light is a favorite vacation spot for Scandinavians , Germans , and Poles . Its position in the middle of the Baltic ( it is closer to Sweden , Poland and Germany than to rest of Denmark ) gives both a secluded , yet international feel .
As of January 2003 Bornholms five regions assembled into one administrative and political unit called Bornholms Regionskommune . As of January 2007 Bornholm belongs to the Capital Region .
A battle between Denmark and Sweden in 1645 led to Swedish control of the island , but it was brief - they left again the same year . In the Roskildepeace of 1658 Bornholm , Skaane , Halland and Blekinge were given to Sweden .
In 1658 the Swedish commander of Bornholm was killed in Rønne , and the people of Bornholm freed themselves from years of foreign command . Bornholm was given to the Danish king as ‘ his island ’ .
Jens Kofoed , Poul Anker , Peder Olsen and Villum Clausen became champions of liberty . The same four men have , in modern times , given name to the ferries from Bornholmstrafikken .
Bornholm was Danish until World War Two , and then was it taken over by the Germans and later freed by the Russians in 1945 ; the Russian wouldn ’ t leave Bornholm because of the progressing cold war and only left after being given some special privileges .
As Bornholm has many tourists each year most people speak either English , German or Swedish , the exception being most of the older population .
Almost all tourist folders are to be found in English , German , Polish and a Scandinavian language .
There is an airport in Rønne and numerous regular flights on a daily basis to Copenhagen are operated by Cimber Air and Danish Air Transport .
Also , Bornholm Airport is an international gateway fulfilling all requirements linked to this fact . Naturally direct booking and luggage check ##AT##-##AT## in to foreign destinations via Copenhagen Airport is available at the ticket office in our air terminal .
You can get to the island by ferry or airplane , but the island also provides excellent opportunities for arriving by private boat .
It ’ s easy getting around either by car , bus or bicycles .
The charge for a trip from the airport to Rønne is approximately € 7 , and a trip from Rønne to Nexø ( longest distance ) is € 50 .
There are 9 bus lines connecting cities and attractions . Some stops are designed for getting off , walking a scenic route and getting on a bus at the next stop .
The BAT 24 hour ticket at € 18 can be a good deal if you travel a few times and do not want to worry about the rates and zones .

Bornholm is famous for its many high quality crafts such as blown glass and textiles . Visit the different shops and exhibits .

Okavango Delta - A unique geological formation where a delta is formed by a river ( the Okavango ) flowing into the Kalahari desert instead of the ocean .
There are several entry points by road to Botswana : In the south at Gaborone , providing access from Johannesburg ; in the west providing access from Namibia ; the north providing access from Namibia , Zambia and Zimbabwe ; and at Francistown in the east , providing access from Harare .
All road access is good and the primary roads within Botswana are paved and well maintained .
The roads are paved and well maintained , so travel by car is also not a problem , provided that one keeps a close eye out for the cows , donkeys and goats that spend much time in the middle of the road .
Botswana Railways operates Botwana &apos;s railways . The main line goes from Lobatse , near the South African border , via Gaborone to Francistown at the Zimbabwean border .
However , effective April 1 , 2009 , all passenger services have been withdrawn .
The language of business in Botswana is English and most people speak it , although in the more rural areas many people do not speak English , particularly the older generations .
Botswana &apos;s currency is the Pula ; 100 Thebe = 1 Pula . In Setswana , pula means &quot; rain &quot; and thebe means &quot; shield .
Nevertheless , crime has been on the rise over the past several years , so always be aware of your surroundings . Basic common sense will keep you safe from the predatory wildlife in rural areas .
Botswana &apos;s HIV infection rate , estimated at 24.1 % &#91; 6 &#93; , is the 2ND highest reported in the world . Exercise regular universal precautions when dealing with any bodily fluid and remain aware of this high rate of infection .
Wear rubber gloves when dressing someone else &apos;s cut , even if they are a child , and obviously NEVER , EVER HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX . If you form a serious relationship , consider both getting an HIV test before taking things further .

Lao Airlines &#91; 8 &#93; - Small airline with 4 flights a week to / from Luang Prabang in Laos , also from Vientiane and from Phnom Penh .
Trains to Nanning , China depart from Gia Lam station , about 5 km north of Hanoi station .
All other trains use the main Hanoi train station ( Ga Hang Co , 120 Le Duan , tel : 825 3949 ) , for daily services from cities in the south including Hue and Nha Trang .
Tickets for all destinations are sold in the main station , though there are two counter halls , north and south , serving the respective destinations .
Buy your tickets as early as possible , especially since sleeper ##AT##-##AT## tickets can be sold out several days in advance .
If you can &apos;t get a ticket anymore , try a travel ##AT##-##AT## agent who still might have stocks . You may also try your luck in the station just before boarding time , agents still holding tickets will be eager to sell as the departure draws near .
Nevertheless , travel agencies in Hanoi are known for their bad business practices .
Some of them will try to overcharge you up to 300 % , so it is better go to the train station by yourself and find out about the prices before you agree on any deal .
Most of the &quot; open ##AT##-##AT## tour &quot; bus itineraries either begin or end in Hanoi , with Hue the next ( or previous ) stop ( 12 ##AT##-##AT## 14 hours , US $ 8 ##AT##-##AT## 9 ) , and from there to Hoi An , Nha Trang , Dalat , Mui Ne , Ho Chi Minh City , and other cities in Vietnam , depending on the bus company .
Many of the same companies also sell tickets to Vientiane and Savannakhet in Laos ( US $ 16 ##AT##-##AT## 18 ) , but do some research before you buy a ticket - rattle ##AT##-##AT## trap scam buses abound on this route .
Taxis are the best way to travel long distances , but the cyclos , or pedicabs , are a cheap way to make shorter trips .
Taxi fares are not always consistent , and the rates for each taxi company have not been standardized .
For lone travelers , rides on the back of motorbikes ( actually low ##AT##-##AT## powered scooters ) are popular too ( known as xe om , literally meaning motorbike ##AT##-##AT## hug ) .
Be very careful with meter taxis in Hanoi .
Some have central locking , and are known to lock passengers in , and demand large amounts of US dollars before letting them go .
The driver may threaten to have you beaten up or arrested should you not give in to his demands , but if you kick up enough of a fuss , they will let you go .
Motorbike drivers can be found on virtually every corner , especially in the Old Quarter . Expect to be offered a ride every half ##AT##-##AT## block ( or more ) .
Negotiate a fare in advance , and again , turn around and walk away if you don &apos;t like their offer . There are far more drivers than tourists , and they know it - your fare could be the only one they get all day .
You might want to write down the negotiated fare to avoid confusion . Even if you do speak Vietnamese , a driver might pretend that you said 50,000 dong instead of 15,000 !
Many drivers will accept US dollars as well . At the end of a ride , some will offer to hang around to drive you to your next destination - GET A PRICE IN ADVANCE , or you might be surprised when the driver demands several million dong for two 10 minute rides .
Keep your wallet out of arms reach of the drivers when you pay , less honest motorbike drivers are not adverse to grabbing your wallet and helping themselves to any notes they like the look of before jumping on their bike and speeding off .
Negotiate first or avoid using the cyclos services , they demand 200,000VND ( US $ 12 ) for a short ride of less than 100 metres .
At the end of the journey , a few men will come over to translate , and they will pretend to help and later insist that you pay the demanded amount .
Motorcycles can be rented for around US $ 5 ##AT##-##AT## 6 a day , and can be arranged by most hotels . This is good for making lots of trips around the city for individuals or duos , but be careful : Hanoi traffic is very difficult place to sharpen motorbike skills .
Park on the sidewalk with other bikes , and be sure to lock the front wheel . Locals will help arrange the bikes near their stores .
Scam free , cheap but a bit difficult to comprehend at first , the buses in Hanoi are relatively fast and surprisingly comfortable . Pick up a map with printed bus lines at the Trang Tien street ( the book street by the Opera house ) and spend a few minutes to identify the over 60 bus lines , find your bus stop , wait for the bus , pay 3000 dong and of you go .
Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum ( Open mornings only , 8 ##AT##-##AT## 11AM ; closed on afternoons , Mondays , and Fridays . Apparently closed October ##AT##-##AT## December for maintenance of the body .
) The city down south may have his name , but only Hanoi has the man himself , entombed in distinctly Lenin ##AT##-##AT## esque fashion - against his wishes , but that &apos;s how it goes . No talking , short pants , or other signs of disrespect allowed while viewing ; photos are allowed only from outside , in the grand Ba Dinh Square .
Purses are allowed into the tomb , but expect them to be searched by several bored soldiers along the way . Left luggage is handled in a complicated scheme : there is an office near the street for large bags , with separate windows for Vietnamese and foreigners , and a further office for cameras , which will be transported to a third office right outside the exit of the mausoleum .
Right around the corner , this gleaming white museum and its gloriously ham ##AT##-##AT## handed iconography are the perfect chaser to the solemnity of the mausoleum . The building , completed in 1990 , is intended to evoke a white lotus .
One of the more informative museums in Vietnam , and perhaps one of the oddest in the world . Guides are available in English , French , Chinese and Russian , but don &apos;t bother ; the displays are labeled in English and French , and it &apos;s hard to imagine the guides doing much other than belaboring the point .
The exit from the mausoleum takes you right into the grounds of the , uh , vestige , where Ho Chi Minh lived and worked from 1954 until his death in 1969 . The nicely landscaped complex includes two of Ho Chi Minh &apos;s houses , kept shiny and &quot; as he left them &quot; by the authorities , as well as a garage with two of Ho &apos;s cars and a carp ##AT##-##AT## filled pond .
One ##AT##-##AT## Pillar Pagoda &amp; MDASH ; Tucked away between the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and Museum .
Travelers find the One ##AT##-##AT## Pillar Pagoda either charming and lovely or utterly pointless , depending on how many tour groups are crammed into the small grounds at the time of their visit .
Temple of Literature ( Văn Miếu ) ( On Quoc Tu Giam St. , south of the Mausoleum .
The Temple of Literature was founded in 1070 and established as the country &apos;s first university six years later .
The courtyard features numerous stone tablets , each mounted on the back of a tortoise , with the names of graduates .
National Museum of Vietnamese History ( Bảo tàng Lịch sử Việt Nam ) , No. 1 , Trang Tien Street ( Admission 15,000 dong / Students 8,000 and under 15 just 2,000 .
Hours : 8AM ##AT##-##AT## 11 : 30AM and from 1 : 30PM ##AT##-##AT## 4 : 30PM . This is a collection from Vietnamese history from about 1000 years back until 1945 .
Many antiques and the such . From 1945 onwards , you can go to the Museum of the Vietnamese Revolution located just a five minute walk away .
Museum of the Vietnamese Revolution ( Bảo tàng Cách mạng Việt Nam ) , 25 Tong Dan Street ( and 216 Tran Quang Khai Street ) Open every day except Monday , from 8AM to 11 : 45AM and from 1 : 30PM to 4 : 15PM Admission 10,000 dong .
This museum gives a very informed and detailed account of the Vietnamese struggle against first the French ( starting in 1858 -- on the first floor ) , then against the Americians ( on the ground floor - ending on 30 April 1975 ) .
Hoan Kiem means &quot; returned sword &quot; , and the name comes from a legend in which King Le Loi was given a magical sword by the gods , which he used to drive out the invading Chinese . Later , while boating on the lake , he encountered a giant turtle , who grabbed the sword and carried it down to its depths , returning it to the gods from whom it had come .
Hoa Lo Prison ( &quot; The Hanoi Hilton &quot; ) , 1 Hoa Lo , Hoan Kiem , Hanoi .
Open 8 : 30AM to 11 : 30AM and 1 : 30PM to 4 : 30PM , admission 5,000 dong .
This prison was built by the French at the turn of the 20th century , in classical French prison design .
This is where the French imprisoned and executed many of the Vietnamese freedom fighters . The prison was also used to hold U.S. prisoners of war .
Now a museum ( 2 / 3 of the prison was torn down to make way for the Hanoi Towers ) , the museum exhibits the brutal French colonial regime and the struggle of the Vietnamese people against imperialism in chilling detail .
B ##AT##-##AT## 52 Lake - Huu Tiep Lake - Ngoc Ha Precinct , Ba Dinh District — Until December 19 , 1972 , this was just a small brackish pond just off Hoang Hoa Tam Street , about 1km west of the mausoleum .
On that day , in a twisted retelling of the Hoan Kiem legend ( see above ) , Vietnamese anti ##AT##-##AT## aircraft guns ( possibly with the help of flying turtles ) retook the enemy &apos;s eight ##AT##-##AT## engined , 100 ##AT##-##AT## ton sword and sent it too , to the shallow bottom of the lake , where it remains today .
Sit on a plastic chair in front of one of the Bia Hoi ( fresh beer ) establishments which are invariably situated on the corners of many of Hanoi &apos;s &apos; Old Quarter &apos; streets .
This preservative ##AT##-##AT## free light beer is the perfect drink to sip as you watch the city &apos;s frenetic life bustle by .
The beer costs less than twenty cents and gives you an excuse to relax and take photos of the passing local characters . Should not be missed .
Moreover , once you reach the Old Quarter , you will find that almost every corner is filled with stalls selling Pho ( Vietnamese noodle ) and cafe ( the name is not limited only to coffee , but also tea , sweets and grocery items , and yes , even to Pho ! ) .
Since the mid 90s , Vietnamese cuisine has been catching up again and is now very diverse and most delicious .
Small hotel in the Old Quarter . The rooms have comfortable beds , amazing hot water pressure for showers and good air ##AT##-##AT## con / fan combos .

With a successful steel , finance and high technology industry , a strategic location at the heart of Western Europe , more natural beauty than you might expect given its size , and as one of the top 3 richest countries in the world , Luxembourg enjoys a very high standard of living .
Overrun by Germany in both World Wars , Luxembourg was one of the major battlefields of the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944 ##AT##-##AT## 1945 , a story well documented in the museum at Diekirch . The state ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following year .
Luxembourg ##AT##-##AT## Findel International Airport ( IATA : LUX ) ( ICAO : ELLX ) &#91; 2 &#93; is located 6km outside Luxembourg ##AT##-##AT## City . It is served by Luxair &#91; 3 &#93; , the national airline , which flies to many EU countries ( including Milan and London Gatwick and City ) and Dublin , and Air France ( Paris ; actually a Luxair codeshare ) , KLM ( Amsterdam ) , Swiss ( Zurich ) , Lufthansa ( Frankfurt ; actually a Luxair codeshare ) and British Airways ( London Gatwick ) .
Alternative airports , especially for low ##AT##-##AT## cast carriers , include Ryanair hub Hahn ( aka &quot; Frankfurt ##AT##-##AT## Hahn &quot; ) , about two hours away by direct Flibco bus &#91; 5 &#93; , Zweibrücken Airport &#91; 6 &#93; and Brussels -South Charleroi , served by bus company charleroiexpress.com &#91; 7 &#93; .
Luxembourg train station can be reached directly from Paris ( 2 hours ) , Metz ( 1 hour ) , Brussels ( 3 hours ) and Trier ( 43 min ) .
Both international and national timetables can be found on the website of the national railways company CFL &#91; 8 &#93; .
Motorways from Metz ( A3 ) , Brussels ( A6 ) and Trier ( A1 ) connect to the ring ##AT##-##AT## road around Luxembourg City , from which most other parts of the country can be reached .
If you want to enjoy a nice view to the city , &quot; Grund &quot; and Kasematten , leave the motorway coming from the East ( Germany ) at exit &quot; Cents &quot; . Enter Cents and drive down the hill .
Aside from the airport buses listed above , sometimes there are commuter buses to Trier and Bitburg .
The train is a far preferable option for entering the country from nearby .
Luxembourg being a landlocked country , it &apos;s extremely hard to get in by boat .
But if you really want to there are boat links form the German side of the Moselle river to the Luxembourg side , but it is easier walking over the bridges .
Luxembourg is a compact country and it &apos;s possible to reach most any place in the country from the capital in under an hour .
The central railway station has a handy Mobiliteit &#91; 9 &#93; office that will help to plan your trip with bus and train .
The Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois ( CFL ) &#91; 10 &#93; train network is either comprehensive or spartan , depending whether you want to go south or north . While the south is reasonably well covered , the north is limited to one main line ( Ligne 10 ) which runs from Luxembourg City via Mersch , Ettelbrück , Wilwerwiltz , Clervaux and Troisvierges .
To the south you can reach Bettembourg and Esch ##AT##-##AT## sur ##AT##-##AT## Alzette . There is also a line to the east which crosses into Germany over the Moselle River at Wasserbillig .
The same tickets are valid on trains as buses , and the same rates apply : € 1.50 for two hours ( unlimited transfers ) or € 4.00 for one day . A € 40 month ticket can be purchased at the CFL office under Hamilius , at some newsagencies or at the station .
From an aesthetic view , perhaps the best way to approach Luxembourg City is by train from the north via Ligne 10 as this is a beautifully scenic route past some of the most well ##AT##-##AT## known Luxembourgish sights .
Within the city , the comprehensive bus service is more than adequate for the average tourist .
Buses numbered 1 ##AT##-##AT## 25 serve the Ville de Luxembourg , with the most useful being the 16 ( Town to the Airport via Kirchberg ) and the 18 ( Town to Kirchberg and Auchan ) .
Almost all buses include the central bus station Hamilius ( centre of town ) and the Station ( Luxembourg Gare ) in their routes at some point .
Any bus pointing stationwards from Hamilius will probably take you there ( the 3 being a notable exception ) .
Bus tickets ( which are also valid on trains ) are available from the driver . A standard ticket costs € 1.50 and will be valid on any bus up to 2 hours after its purchase .
Every village has a convenient bus service which runs at least once every hour .
Buses numbered 100 upwards will take you out of the city .
Useful routes to the north of the country include the 100 ( Diekirch via Junglinster , every hour ) , the 120 ( Junglinster , every 30 minutes ) and the 290 ( Mersch , frequent ) .
Town buses experienced a reduced service on Saturdays ( including those used mainly by shoppers ) , and many routes are barely existent ( if at all ) on a Sunday .
This doesn &apos;t matter , though , since most shops and attractions are closed on a Sunday .
Almost all national buses run the same on Saturdays ( which count as working days in this instance ) as during the week , but the Sunday service is usually reduced or non ##AT##-##AT## existent .
Luxembourg &apos;s road infrastructure is well ##AT##-##AT## developed if not always very well thought ##AT##-##AT## out .
Anywhere that happens to lie along the major motorways is easily accessible via these ( including Grevenmacher in the east , Mamer to the west and Bettembourg to the south ) .
Esch ##AT##-##AT## Alzette , the country &apos;s second city ( more like a small town by international standards ) has its own motorway link , the A4 .
In addition , a new motorway is being built towards the north of the country ( Mersch , Ettelbrück ) , but this won &apos;t be completed until 2010 at the earliest .
However , the current North Road provides easy access to these areas for the moment .
Current national speed limits are 50km / h in towns and villages , 90km / h on open country roads ( 110 in some places on N7 and N11 ) , and 130km / h on the motorway ( 110 in the rain ) . 70km / h also exists in some places .
Be aware that if you have a right ##AT##-##AT## hand ##AT##-##AT## drive car then you are very likely to be singled out for a customs check on the way in . Police are also very keen on stopping drivers for having the &apos; wrong &apos; lights on in town , i.e.
Finding parking in Luxembourg city centre on the weekends is a pain .
Most parking spaces are quickly taken and some parking garages close early .
The best option is to find somewhere near the station and then walk around the city centre . Traffic wardens are also numerous and vigilant .
The streets and landscape in Luxembourg make for good biking territory ; highly recommended .
Be wary , though , of small ##AT##-##AT## ish bicycle repair shops in rural corners of the country -- they may quite well charge you quite some money for fixing your bike when they actually break it , more or less subtly .
For bicycle repairs , neighboring Trier ( with a considerable University student population ) is usually a safer bet .
Hence , again knowing French is your best bet if you want to converse with most people , especially as people working in shops and bars usually come from France or Belgium and don &apos;t bother to learn the local native language . English is widely understood by such personnel as bus drivers , but many shop assistants will only respond if addressed in French .
Luxembourg uses the euro , so there is no need to change money if coming in from Belgium , France or Germany .
If you know any coin collectors , take a few local coins as keepsakes , since Luxembourgish coins are among the rarest of the euros — even in Luxembourg , most of your change will be in other countries &apos; coins !
In most restaurants however , the typical local food would be French cuisine coming in bigger portions .
Italian food has been popular since the 1960s .
Home cooking has been very influenced by the recipes of Ketty Thull , apparently the best ##AT##-##AT## selling cooking and baking book in Luxembourg since WW II .
The Luxembourg white wines from the Moselle valley to the east of Luxembourg include Riesling , Pinot Gris , Pinot Blanc , Rivaner and Elbling to name just a few and are good .
Young people tend to drink local or imported beer . Luxembourg has a number of breweries , with Diekirch , from the village of the same name , Bofferding , Battin , and Mousel being the most popular .
Despite the fact that you would be hard pushed to find any of these outside of the country , all are excellent lagers .
Thanks to the heavy banking and EU presence in the city , hotels in central Luxembourg are quite expensive , although there is a good youth hostel ( see Luxembourg ( city ) # Sleep ) .
It may be more cost ##AT##-##AT## effective to stay across the border in eg .
Trier and &quot; commute &quot; into Luxembourg , as a day ##AT##-##AT## ticket valid for a return trip and free run of the entire country is only € 8.40 .
A number of smaller hotels in Luxembourg , mostly in the countryside but including a few in the city , have banded together at hotels.lu &#91; 11 &#93; .
Many thousands of people commute from neighbouring Belgium , France ( Les frontaliers ) and Germany on week days , considerably swelling the population of the capital city . The majority work in the numerous financial institutions based in the capital and are drawn across the borders by the excellent salaries on offer .
Luxembourg City has a very international flavour as in addition to les frontaliers , it attracts young professionals from all over the globe .
In this area , business is done predominently in English , French or German and it is necessary to be fluent in one of these as a minimum although many jobs will demand proficiency in at least two .
In many surveys , Luxembourg has been named &quot; safest country in the world &quot; .
The food and tap water supply in Luxembourg is perfectly fine and the country &apos;s healthcare system is first ##AT##-##AT## class .
The climate is average even though the summers can get hot . However these temperatures only rarely rise much above 30 ° C.
Try to show respect for the local language and make some effort to say a word or two of it even if it &apos;s just the standard greeting &quot; Moien &quot; .

Namibia &#91; 1 &#93; is in Southern Africa , bordering South Africa , Botswana , Angola , Zambia and the Atlantic Ocean . Formerly a colony of Germany , Namibia was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate after WWI , and annexed as a province of South Africa after WWII .
The South ##AT##-##AT## West African People &apos;s Organization ( SWAPO ) launched a guerrilla war for independence in 1966 , but did not gain independence until 1990 .
Namibia boasts remarkable natural attractions such as the Namib desert , the Fish River Canyon Park , Etosha National Park and the Kalahari desert .
Its people speak nine different languages , including some of the Khoisan languages which include the &apos; clicks &apos; that present an enigma to most native English ##AT##-##AT## speakers . Namibia produces some of the world &apos;s highest quality diamonds .
Swakopmund -- Coastal town , a mecca for Namibians on holiday .
Tsumeb -- Mining town east of Etosha .
Brandberg Mountains -- The highest mountain in Namibia at 2 573 m .
Skeleton Coast -- The northern coastal part of the Namib desert , named for the dozens of ships that were beached in the thick fog that is frequent where the desert meets the Atlantic .
Tourists may enter Namibia for up to 3 months .
Namibia ( along with Lesotho , South Africa and Swaziland ) is a member of the Southern African Common Monetary Area and as such the Namibian Dollar ( NAD ) is pegged 1 : 1 to the South African Rand ( ZAR ) .
Both the Namibian Dollar and South African Rand is legal tender in Namibia though change will usually be given in Namibian Dollars .
Banks in Namibia will convert Namibian Dollars for South African Rand and vice versa without charge or paperwork .
Since any bank or currency exchange outside Namibia ( including other members of the Common Monetary Area ) will charge a substantial service fee to change currency , it is advisable to make use of a Namibian Bank before leaving the country .
It is also advisable to carry proof ( for example ATM receipts ) that money you are taking out of the country is money that you brought into the country in the first place .
Automated teller machines are available in Windhoek , Swakopmund , Luderitz , Tsumeb , and other towns and cities .
It is best to use only teller machines that are inside a mall or other building .
Always be careful to make sure no one is watching you enter your PIN , and be vigilant about typical scams ( e.g.
machines that seem to eat your card and won &apos;t give it back after you enter the PIN ) .
Prices in shops are fixed , but prices in open markets or from street vendors are open to barter .
Vegetarians need not apply . Namibians have a very high intake of meat .
It is possible to be a vegetarian in Namibia , however , as there are some Peace Corps workers who live there for two years and remain vegetarian throughout .
you will find local and international cuisine in the many diverse restaurants and cafes .
3 course gourmet dinners on red dune under the stars accompanied with staff entertainment NS 220 pp .
A hotel provides accommodation to the traveling public , has a reception area and offers at least a &quot; breakfast room &quot; or communal eating area .
In general a hotel makes food and beverage services available to a guest , though these may be outsourced or provided by the hotel .
The HIV infection rate in Namibia is about 25 % .
Namibia &apos;s medical system is modern and capable of attending to whatever needs you may have .
Staff are well trained and so HIV transmission in hospitals is not an issue .
This applies to government and private hospitals alike , though line ##AT##-##AT## ups are often shorter at private hospitals , and there have been cases of incorrect diagnosis in government hospitals .
Namibia &apos;s water supply is usually safe to drink , except where labelled otherwise .
Campsites next to rivers often get their water directly from the river , so do not drink it !
Having said all this , make sure you consult a physician specializing in health issues of Southern Africa , as well as things like the Centre for Disease Control &#91; 17 &#93; web page . Make sure you satisfy yourself of the safety of anything you &apos;re getting into .
It is a well developed country ( albeit still a developing nation ) with all the modern amenities and technologies . Don &apos;t show up wearing khaki shorts and a safari hat ; people will laugh .
In fact , Namibians refer to this kind of tourist as The Khakis in a derogative manner . And if you ask where the &apos; real &apos; Africa is ( i.e. , the Africa of Tarzan ) , Namibians may very well be offended .
It is customary when greeting someone to ask them how they &apos;re doing . It &apos;s a simple exchange where each person asks &quot; How are you ?
&quot; ) and responds with a correspondingly short answer , and then proceed with whatever your business is about . It &apos;s a good idea to do this at tourist info booths , in markets , when getting into taxis , even in shops in Windhoek ( though it &apos;s normally not done in some of the bigger stores in the malls ) .
Each city or region has a two ##AT##-##AT## digit area code . When calling long distance within Namibia , prefix the area code with a &apos; 0&apos; .
Mobile phones are very common and run on the GSM network , using the same frequency as Europe and the rest of Africa .
There are Internet cafes in Windhoek , Swakopmund and Opuwo , and hostels often have access as well .
Namibia has two GSM cellular phone operators , MTC &#91; 18 &#93; and CellOne &#91; 19 &#93; and both offer prepaid options .
Starter packs and airtime vouchers are readily available at most stores .

Normandy &#91; 1 &#93; ( French : Normandie ) is a region of northern France , bordering the English Channel .
Normandy is famed for the D ##AT##-##AT## Day Allied invasion on June 6 , 1944 .
You can choose to go the whole way if you can walk for a month ! Otherwise select day trips or 2 ##AT##-##AT## 3 days trips in the most interesting parts : History fans will choose the D ##AT##-##AT## Day beaches , while lovers of spectacular nature ( cliffs and coves ) will walk around la Cap de la Hague , west of Cherbourg , or choose to walk to Mont Saint Michel .
Weather in Normandy can be unpredictable but is often very nice . One of the best seasons to visit Normandy is September .

Chinatown ##AT##-##AT## North Beach in San Francisco combines two adjoining neighbors , both of whom are among the city &apos;s most popular immigrant neighborhoods . Culturally and aesthetically , they could not be more different yet their streets mesh seamlessly together .
This &quot; Little Italy , &quot; with its cafes and alfresco dining , has a real European charm and flavor reminiscent of the romance of Europe and Italy . The area runs from roughly Bay Street to the north , Columbus Avenue and Powell Street on the west , San Francisco Bay on the east , and Washington Street on the south with an extension to Sutter Street between Kearny and Powell Streets to encompass the rest of Chinatown .
Many of the Chinese who settled here were merchants or immigrant workers , working on either the transcontinental railroad or as mine workers during the Gold Rush . Today , it is home for more than 15,000 Chinese and Chinese ##AT##-##AT## Americans , many of whom are low ##AT##-##AT## income , elderly , and foreign born , living in dense tenements .
Chinatown holds a prominent position in the history of Chinese and Chinese ##AT##-##AT## Americans in the United States , from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 to the present day . The residual &quot; bachelor &quot; society one finds in San Francisco &apos;s Chinatown today cannot be understood without some knowledge of these hostile decades .
The Chinatown market area is mainly along Stockton Street , one block above ( west of ) Grant Avenue , and the east ##AT##-##AT## west streets crossing Stockton . Other San Francisco concentrations of Chinese shops and restaurants are located in the Inner Richmond District , mainly along Clement , and the Outer Sunset District , mainly along Irving .
Forming part of the old Barbary Coast ( an extinct neighborhood infamous for its crime , prostitution , and general unruliness ) , and popular with both locals and tourists alike , North Beach remains one of the most popular and beloved neighborhoods in San Francisco . Nestled between Chinatown to the south and Fisherman &apos;s Wharf to the north , North Beach is the Italian part of town and is known by the moniker &quot; Little Italy .
The neighborhood derived its name as the bay shoreline originally reached as far as Taylor and Francisco streets , and the area was indeed a real beach until the city subsequently filled it in . The portion of Grant Avenue that runs straight through North Beach is the oldest street in San Francisco .
North Beach was also the West Coast &apos;s capital for the Beatnik movement in the 1950s — you can still see many of the places where Jack Kerouac and the &quot; Dharma Bums &quot; hung out and wrote their dark poetry . Other literati celebrities that hung out there were ; Alan Ginsberg , Neal Cassidy ( Dean Moriarity in Kerouac &apos;s On The Road ) , and Lawrence Ferlinghetti .
&quot; The area is still full of adult bookstores and strip clubs ; despite this , strangely , like everything in San Francisco , it retains a certain charm . Washington Square ( another old Beat hangout ) , in front of the Saints Peter and Paul Church , is a very popular hangout with locals , and a great place to relax .
Driving into the area is not recommended , but if you must , the closest parking garage to Chinatown is underneath Portsmouth Plaza , on Kearny Street ( which is a one ##AT##-##AT## way street north ) between Clay and Washington .
Other Chinatown garages are the Golden Gateway at 250 Clay Street , North Beach at 755 Vallejo Street , and St. Mary &apos;s Square at 433 Kearny Street .
All garages are open 24 hours a day , except for Golden Gateway . There are also a few small parking garages scattered throughout North Beach , including Imperial Parking at 425 Broadway Street .
Driving to the base of Coit Tower is definitely not recommended , as there is a very limited amount of parking at the top of the hill .
Both routes will take you into Chinatown , but the Powell ##AT##-##AT## Mason line is a better bet for getting to North Beach as the Powell ##AT##-##AT## Hyde line turns west at Jackson and proceeds into Russian Hill . To reach Chinatown &apos;s famous Grant Avenue via the cable car , exit BART or the MUNI Metro at the Embarcadero Station and catch the California cable car line at California and Market .

Tourist visas are no longer required for citizens of the European Union , United States , Canada , Japan , Switzerland , Liechtenstein , Andorra , Vatican City , Monaco , Iceland , Norway , San Marino , Mongolia , Serbia , Montenegro and the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States ( except Turkmenistan ) .
This applies only for tourist travel lasting less than 90 days .
Customs officials might inquire about the amount being brought into the country . It is prohibited to bring large amounts of Ukrainian currency ( hryvnia ) in to the country unless it was declared upon leaving Ukraine .
It is advisable to check in advance the customs regulations ( e.g.
When entering the country you will be required to complete an immigration form - currently this is a simple white document with two parts that have more or less identical information . Both parts should be completed on arrival : the immigration officer will keep one part and you have to retain the second , which you will need to show to the immigration officer on your departure from the country .
It is not advisable to lose this easily lost scrap of paper , as you &apos;ll almost certainly have difficulties on leaving Ukraine ( and likely incur a &quot; fine &quot; too ) . You will need to know where you are going to stay as this is required on the form and the immigration officer will insist that it is filled in .
Special offers on flights come and go , depending on the whim of the carrier . Recently the low ##AT##-##AT## cost airline Wizzair started operations within Ukraine and will start one international route from Kyiv to London Luton airport in December 2008 .
There are several airlines which offer direct flights to cities like Dnipropetrovsk ( Lufthansa ) , Donetsk ( Lufthansa , Austrian ) , Odessa ( MALEV , LOT , Austrian , CSA Czech Airlines ) , Kharkiv and Lviv ( LOT , Austrian Airlines ) , but they are more expensive .
Planes used are newer Boeing 737 and 767 aircraft . Ukraine International also recently introduced flights within the country from its hub in Kyiv , mainly flying newer Boeing 737 aircraft .
One can enter Ukraine by train &#91; 2 &#93; from any land ##AT##-##AT## bordering neighbor .
When coming from Western Europe there will be a wait at the border while the train &apos;s bogies are changed in order to adapt to a different rail gauge .
It &apos;s generally quicker and cheaper to buy a ticket to the border and then change trains , rather than wait getting through train .
Generally , in Ukraine railway travel is much cheaper than flying , and is comparable ( but probably cheaper ) to bus or car travel .
It will take at most a whole day to ride across the country , so unless you are in hurry take a train .
It &apos;s good practice to take long ##AT##-##AT## distance trains , which are much more comfortable .
Avoid cheap third ##AT##-##AT## class travel if you &apos;re cautious of local experiences .
The nearest significant town on the Polish side is Przemyśl , and it &apos;s straightford to find by following route # 4 ( which passes through Przemyśl ) , also known as the E40 in European terms .
When you arrive , the road is fairly narrow ( no motorway / autobahn this ) with a queue of trucks and vans parked to the right of the road ; a hard ##AT##-##AT## core parking area with cafe / bar to the left .
Don &apos;t stop behind the goods vehicles , slip up the side of them and then feed into the customs area when the guy flags you forward ( for courteous Europeans , you &apos;re not jumping the queue - commercial traffic goes through a different process ) .
If you &apos;re in an EU registered car then make for the EU ##AT##-##AT## passports , passport control section . Thence to Ukrainian passport control and then Ukrainian customs and then you &apos;re through .
It used to be a nightmare , with apocalyptic tales of 5 ##AT##-##AT## 6 + hours at the border ( and as of July 2007 , this is still a possibility ) , but the Ukrainians have made great advances in efficiency and it takes about an hour to make the crossing ( September 2005 - still true in Feb 2006 ) .
Don &apos;t expect the border police to treat you in a friendly or even respectful manner , in fact , expect anything ranging from neutral to extremely dickish behavior .
Once through , just follow the main road towards Lviv on the E40 - this is the route right across Ukraine to Kyiv ( and thence on to the East ) . Stick to this - the main towns on the way are Lviv , Rivne , Zhytomyr .
You can walk across the 200 meter long bridge from Sighetul Marmatiei , Romania . But once you get to Slatina , Ukraine , it may be difficult to engage onward travel unless you came in a car .
Bicycling is also a possibility in summer .
There are inexpensive direct bus services to Lviv and Ivano ##AT##-##AT## Frankivsk from Poland .
There are some ferries from Istanbul , Georgia , Varna ( Bulgaria ) to Odessa or to Crimea .
The signs are all in Ukrainian ( Cyrillic alphabet ) . Only a few signs ( every 200km or so ) are written in the Latin alphabet , and indicate main cities .
You are strongly advised to respect the signs , especially speed limits . Be aware that unlike in Western countries , where limits are repeated several times , in Ukraine , an obligation or a prohibition is often indicated on a single sign , which you must not miss .
Speed in cities is limited to 60km / h ( 40mph ) .
Speed on highways is limited to 110 ##AT##-##AT## 120km / h ( 75mph ) .
Be aware that corruption is widespread among Ukrainian police , and tourists are an especially profitable target . When you are stopped for speeding or other offenses , officers might aggressively try and extract ridiculous sums of money from you ( € 100 and up ) , offering &quot; reductions &quot; if you pay on the spot ( the proposed alternative being some unpleasant and more expensive way , all made up ) .
If you mention that , they &apos;ll let you off the hook quicker than you know it . At any rate , write down the officers &apos; badge numbers , rank , plate number of the police car , and notify the nearest embassy / consulate in detail , to help fight these corrupt practices .
Fuel is no longer a problem in Ukraine , especially for those who remember travelling to Ukraine during the early 1990s , when gasoline was considered precious . Today , there are plenty service stations .
There are varying types of fuel , such as diesel , unleaded 95 octane , and ( more rarely ) unleaded 98 octane ; one finds also 80 and 76 octane . Note that if you choose to fill ##AT##-##AT## up in a rural filling station , you will need to pay first , and in cash .
The main roads are okay for all cars , as long as you don &apos;t go too fast .
Numerous running repairs have created a patchwork road surface , and it will seriously test your suspension - even on the major dual carriageways .
Secondary roads are passable , but beware : certain zones can be full of potholes and you must treat them with extra care , or avoid them entirely .
Roads between villages are often little more than dirt tracks and not metalled .
Treat as inaccessible unless you &apos;re driving a 4x4 .
Road works have been ongoing , but the quality of the roads is shy of Western Europe ( with the exception of Kyiv ) ...
Be careful when driving in towns or villages .
Sometimes pets prefer to walk on the road , and they are a hazard for all drivers .
You &apos;re likely to see plenty of animals hit by cars , so be prepared ...
Also , don &apos;t be surprised to see plenty of horse drawn carts - even on the dual carriageways .
There are two major bus companies that run buses from all of the major cities to and from Kyiv , they are Avtolux , and Gunsel .
Prices run about 55 ##AT##-##AT## 70 Hryvnia ( 11 ##AT##-##AT## 13 USD ) for service to Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv .
The major advantage that the bus service has , is that it leaves from Boryspil and stops in Kyiv , so if your destination is not Kyiv , its easier then taking a bus to the Main Passenger Railway Station in Kyiv .
Aerosvit offers cheap flights and is a time ##AT##-##AT## saving alternative to the slow and inefficient train service .
For example the flight Odesa ##AT##-##AT## Kyiv ( One ##AT##-##AT## Way ) is ~ 180 USD ( including Tax &amp; all fees ) and takes 1.5 hours . However , be sure to book early for the cheapest fares .
The flights can be booked online via www.aerosvit.ua , comfortably in English .
WizzAir , as of early 2009 , offers flights between Lviv , Kyiv and Simferopol at competitive prices .
It &apos;s possible to go by hitchhiking - usually cargo trucks will take you for free - but it &apos;s still worth to try stop personal cars as well .
Good people are everywhere ; you may be picked up in a Lada or a Lexus .
If you are outside a big city or in doubt about food , exercise caution and common sense about where you buy food .
Try to buy groceries only in supermarkets or large grocery stores , always check the expiration date , and never buy meat or dairy products on the street ( you can buy them on the market , but not near the market ) .
Hotels might be a traumatic experience for a westerner anywhere outside Kyiv . The cheaper the hotel , the larger the chance of some quite unfortunate surprises , especially for those not familiar with the Soviet ##AT##-##AT## style level of service which still remains in many places .
For instance in IvanoFrankivsk ( near the Carpathians ) , the going rate is approximately 35 euro for a suite ( bedroom and sitting room ) in Hotel Nadia . Many hotels have the choice between renovated rooms / suites ( &quot; western style &quot; ) and not renovated rooms ( easteuropean style ) .
There are only three 5 ##AT##-##AT## star hotels : in Kyiv called the Premier Palace and Opera , and another one in Doneck called Donbass Palace , but they are very expensive .
Two western hotels recently opened , Radisson SAS and Hyatt .
They are not on the cheap side either and are usually full , so make reservations in advance .
Another option is to rent an apartment on the Internet before you leave your country .
There &apos;s many to choose from in Kyiv and Odessa . Tip : Read Kyiv in your pocket on Internet !
What many people from ex ##AT##-##AT## soviet countries do is to go to the railway station , where they try to find people who are willing to rent a room .
Prices are usually much cheaper and if there are enough people offering the room you can make great deals ( in Yalta people are almost fighting to be able to talk to you ) .
Opposite , if being arrested by police or other law enforcement - do your best to inform them that you &apos;re a foreign visitor . Not many police officials speak foreign languages freely , however many people are eager to assist in translation .
The Euro and US dollar are generally accepted as alternative forms of currency , particularly in tourist areas .
Ukraine has some of the worst statistics for road related deaths and injuries in the world - so act accordingly .
Take care when crossing the roads ; walk and drive defensively - be aware that traffic overtakes on both the inside and outside .
Sometimes you even need to take care when using the sidewalks , as in rush ##AT##-##AT## hours the black , slab ##AT##-##AT## sided Audi / BMW / Mercedes sometimes opt to avoid the traffic by using the wide sidewalks ; pedestrians or not .
Owners / drivers of expensive cars have been known , at times , to be more careless of the safety of pedestrians . Drivers rarely grant priority to pedestrians crossing a road unless there are pedestrian lights .
Also be warned that pavements suffer in the same way as the roads in terms of collapsing infrastructure . Take care when walking , especially in the dark and away from the downtown areas of the main cities ( a torch / flashlight is a useful possession ) as the streets are poorly lit , as are most of the entries / stairwells to buildings , and the street and sidewalk surfaces are often dangerously pot ##AT##-##AT## holed .
Ukraine is by no means a conservative country with respect to clothing , behaviour , overcharging you if they can get by with it , getting what you paid for ( quality ) . It is very different from our western perspective in some of these cases .

‘ Land of a Thousand Volcanoes ’ – this unique island of spent lava fields is recognised as a World Biosphere Reserve .
But amidst this lunar like landscape are fabulous beaches , palm oases , and a cultural history that can be enjoyed throughout the year , thanks to its wonderful climate .
Known as &apos; the miniature continent &apos; , for the variety of climates and landscapes that can be found on this most developed of the seven Canary Islands .
From the big city bustle of the capital , Las Palmas , to the secluded serenity of its many beaches and lush woodlands , Gran Canarias offers a wide range of sights and activities year round .
Golf courses , yacht marinas , conference centres , theme parks , beaches ... Tenerife offers a complete range of leisure activities to satisfy all kinds of tastes .
Under the attentive gaze of El Teide , the highest mountain in Spain , and with the sea as an ever ##AT##-##AT## present backdrop , visitors can experience the rich diversity of its landscape and micro ##AT##-##AT## climates .
The unusual sight of windmills , a reminder of its farming past , can be found throughout the island , which is known as the ‘ granary of the Canary Islands ’ .
Despite its desert like landscape it has over one hundred and fifty beaches , the most extensive coastal platform of the archipelago , three thousand hours of sunshine a year and a naturally peaceful environment .
La Palma is called the &apos; Pretty Isle &apos; by Canary Islanders for its spectacularly lush vegetation , abundant clear waters and floral wealth which are in sharp contrast to the many volcanic forms that are testimony to the island &apos;s origins .
Along with the natural beauty of the island , is a culture rich in traditions , crafts and cuisine that has survived from aboriginal times for everyone to enjoy today .
La Gomera is surprisingly varied and full of contrasts ; impressive gorges , grand rock monoliths , marvellous palm groves and the Garajonay National Park , a unique ecological treasure of crystal clear waters and green laurel forests .
The natural wealth of the whole Island is so impressive that it has , in fact , won the highest possible distinction as a protected natural space .
El Hierro is a magic island , and Pozo de la Salud , a prodigious spring with curative properties , adds to the magic , as do the fascinating underwater formations seen just off the rugged coastline .
All this , plus the kind and friendly nature of the people , makes a visit to the smallest of the Canary Islands a charmed experience .

Unless you seriously want to recompile some of the drivers , there is NO reason to download any of the source archives .

New on April 5th : An updated linux kernel with support for a number of video cards not covered in the one uploaded 2 days ago is available here .
Please note that this is only for people who have such cards ; This kernel does support neither nVidia nor Matrox cards , and not VESA , either .

An error occurred during the upgrade !
What &apos;s the meaning of the messages while starting XAMPP ?
Apache doesn &apos;t seems to start . What can I do ?
What do I do if the error message is &quot; Invalid argument : Could not set permissions on ssl ##UNDERSCORE## mutex &quot; ?
What do I do if the error message is » Invalid argument : Configuration failed « ?
What do I do if the error message is » The configuration file now needs a secret passphrase ( blowfish ##UNDERSCORE## secret ) « shows up ?
After I rebooted my Linux box XAMPP stopped running ! How can I fix this ?
How can I make my XAMPP installation more secure ?
How do I backup / restore my XAMPP system ?
If you donwloaded a wrong version you will get an error message if you try to upgrade .
By the way : It doesn &apos;t matter where in the filesystem you extract the packet . Just make sure it &apos;s on the same machine as your XAMPP installation .
After unpacking the archive you can start the upgrade process .
By the way : the upgrade will stop a running XAMPP and will start XAMPP as soon as the upgrade is finished .
XAMPP will be started after an upgrade even if it was not running before .
The upgrade program carefully tried to upgrade one of your configuration files .
In order to upgrade the file , the program had to edit some lines you had already changed .
Seeing as nobody wants to lose valuable configuration information , the upgrade program decided not to change the file but save a copy of the new file in addition to the original one .
The LAMPP startup script did not start XAMPP ##AT##-##AT## Apache because there is an Apache instance already running .
To start XAMPP properly , first you have to stop this daemon .
Mostly due to the same reasons as the above error . The LAMPP startup script found a MySQL daemon already running on your system .
To start LAMPP properly , you have to stop this daemon first .
XAMPP needs a newer Linux distribution that uses the glibc 2.1 version .
Good question : ) This error can exist for multiple reasons .
If you now see &quot; Invalid argument : Could not set permissions on ssl ##UNDERSCORE## mutex &quot; or &quot; Invalid argument : Unable to create scoreboard &quot; please take a look at answers below . If you see another error message please email it to me .
In this case you have to change the Group directive ( about line 318 ) in / opt / lampp / etc / httpd.conf.
In this case you have to remove the hash ( # ) in front of the Scoreboard directive ( about line 71 ) in / opt / lampp / etc / httpd.conf.
Now this error message should not bother you anymore .
In this case , Apache is unable to get the IP address for your host name .
It should normally work but sometimes ( mostly if you &apos;re using DHCP ) this situation could happen .
Simply call the following command ( Please use copy &amp; paste .
This will fix the configuation error of your system and the » Configuration failed « error should dissapear .
This message may appear since XAMPP for Linux 1.2 was released .
Since version 2.5.2 , phpMyAdmin supports the encryption of cookie ##AT##-##AT## saved passwords .
Edit config.inc.php at line 60 . You find this file in the phpmyadmin directory of your XAMPP installation .
Since version 4 - I think - SELinux is activated by default and this is preventing the succesful start of XAMPP .
If you know a better solution , please email me . I &apos;m no SELinux expert and the only I know about SELinux is how to disable it .
That &apos;s normal Linux behaviour ( which applies to any other Unix ##AT##-##AT## like system .
It &apos;s the admin &apos;s job to make sure a particular application is started at bootup .
You should now see a line containing a number between two colons .
In most cases 3 or 5 ( 2 if you &apos;re using Debian ) .
Now XAMPP should start and stop automatically if you boot or shutdown your machine .
And than use the runlevel editor ( expert mode ) from YaST to activate XAMPP for the specific runlevels .
XAMPP : Your XAMPP pages are NOT secured by a password .
XAMPP : MySQL has no root passwort set ! !
Remove the semicolon at the beginning of each line and restart XAMPP .
Now the extension should be active .
I have only had a few chances to test this feature , so please report if this worked for you or not : oswald ##AT## apachefriends.org.
Warning : The backup and restore functionality is still under development and may not work correctly .
Where secret is your MySQL root password .
The file / opt / lampp / backup / xampp ##AT##-##AT## backup ##AT##-##AT## 22 ##AT##-##AT## 01 ##AT##-##AT## 04.sh ( in the example above ) contains your backuped data .
Get this file to a save place .
On the new machine you need the same version of XAMPP as on your original / source machine .
As you can read you may need to restart XAMPP .
It should work perfectly ( I tested it many times ) but remember it &apos;s a beta feature .

The Aro gTér is a stream of Vajrayana Buddhism in which ordination is congruous with romance , marriage , and family life .
It focuses on the teaching and practice of the Inner Tantras from the point of view Dzogchen an essential non ##AT##-##AT## dual teaching .
The Aro gTér tradition is possibly unique in its applicability to Western people .
Due to the predominance of the Dzogchen perspective , the Aro gTér emphasises : assimilation with everyday working life ; appreciative sexual equality ; the spiritual dimension of romantic relationship ; artistic creativity ; and the pursuit of life enhancing engagement with the Arts and challenging physical skill – such as equestrianism .
Students practice within the context of their ordinary lives : marrying , raising families , and engaging in the activities of life which are common to the general population .
Practitioners in the Aro tradition reside in Great Britain , North America , Austria , Germany , Switzerland , Sweden , and Finland .
The Aro gTér is a cycle of teachings revealed by the female visionary , Aro Lingma ( 1886 – 1923 ) and is based entirely in the three Inner Tantras of Nyingma Vajrayana .
The Nyingma Tradition traces its origins to the first spread of Buddhism in Tibet , to the time of the Tantric Buddhas : Padmasambhava and Yeshé Tsogyel .
Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen are the current Lineage Holders of the Aro gTér and teach as a couple .
They make it a priority in their teaching activities to facilitate their students in viewing their relationships and family lives as key spiritual practice .
As representatives of a lineage founded by a woman , they are keen to help women become spiritual practitioners and teachers – and therefore children are always welcome on retreats .
They have encouraged the founding of three other sanghas through their disciples Ngala Rig ’ dzin Dorje and Tsalgyür Wangmo , Ngala Nor ’ dzin Pamo and Ngala ’ ö ##AT##-##AT## Dzin Tridral , and Ngakma Shardröl Du ##AT##-##AT## nyam Wangmo .
Ngala Rig ’ dzin Dorje and Tsalgyür Wangmo teach and guide their sangha in Continental Europe and Scandinavia ; Ngala Nor ’ dzin and Ngala ’ ö ##AT##-##AT## Dzin teach and guide their sangha in Britain ; and Ngakma Shardröl teaches and guides her sangha in the USA .
Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen ’ s sangha are found in Britain and the USA .
They teach twice a year in the USA , in New York and California .
The Aro gTér Lineage has been passed down through a line of enlightened women originating with Yeshé Tsogyel and continuing to the great gTértön Khyungchen Aro Lingma ( 1886 – 1923 ) .
Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche is the incarnation of Aro Yeshé the son of Khyungchen Aro Lingma .
Aro gTér practice is entirely Inner Tantra – from the perspective of Dzogchen .
This means that yogic song , silent sitting , mantra recitation , and sKu ##AT##-##AT## mNyé ( physical yogic exercises ) play a central part in practitioners lives .
This is a colourful , energetic lineage where craft , thangka painting , namkha ( sky ##AT##-##AT## weaving ) , cham ( Tantric dance ) , Tantric orchestra , and appreciation of sensory experience are celebrated .
In comparison to other Traditions , the Aro gTér is non ##AT##-##AT## monastic and therefore far less emphasis is placed on practices such as liturgical recitation , sadhana ( rituals and detailed visualisation ) and cho ##AT##-##AT## pa ( ritual offering practices ) .
Lamas of this tradition teach according to the ethos of Dzogchen both formally and through the simple spontaneity of informal situations .
The Tibetan word Lama means not only the external teacher , but also the internal teacher – which is our beginninglessly enlightened nature .
The rôle of the Lama is to mirror the student .
This mirroring is a means of reflecting the students innate realisation – and his or her own pattern of confusion .
The Lamas therefore encourage apprentices to regard their whole lives as practice – both practically and inspirationally .
The Apprenticeship Programme developed by Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen is an effective method of working with students who are seriously interested in the practices of the Aro gTér .
Apprentices practise under the direction of their Lamas .
Guidance and transmission are given through : dynamic personal instruction ; group question and answer sessions ; shared meditation ; yogic song ; and , by being amongst their apprentices .
Apprentices who have studied and practised with the Aro Lamas for five years have the opportunity to take ngakpa / ngakma or naljorpa / naljorma ordination .
Both ordinations are for those who have realistically come to regard the Lamas as their root teachers ( Tsa ##AT##-##AT## wa ’ i Lamas ) .
Ordination is for those who regard the tradition , lineage , and practice as the most important part of their lives .
The Aro gTér lineage follows the Vajrayana gö ##AT##-##AT## kar chang ##AT##-##AT## lo style of practice which emphasises transformation .
Its practitioners are known by their white skirts and uncut hair .
The Vajrayana path of transformation is well suited to people who are inspired to practice using their everyday life circumstances as the path to realisation .
At the encouragement of Kyabjé Düdjom Rinpoche , Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen have established an ordained gö ##AT##-##AT## kar chang ##AT##-##AT## lo sangha in the West .
Sixty students have taken this step ( as of 2006 ) , and others are working toward it .
There are now three strong gö ##AT##-##AT## kar chang ##AT##-##AT## lo sanghas in the West and it is established that this lineage of ordination will continue to grow under the guidance of their Lamas .
At the Ordination Retreat in Baarlo , Netherlands in January 2000 , sixteen apprentices took ordination into the gö kar chang ##AT##-##AT## lo ’ i dé . Among them were three apprentices of Ngala Rig ’ dzin Dorje , who were the first in his sangha to take these vows .
Two large appliqué thangkas were brought from Austria for the event , one of Yeshé Tsogyel and the one seen here of Padmakara in the form of Guru Nang ##AT##-##AT## srid Zilngön . These appliqué thangkas were made by the sangha of Ngala Rig ’ dzin Dorje on a series of intensive Vajrayana craft retreats , and are a wonderful example of the energy of the Aro gTér tradition in the West .
Gradually over the week of the craft retreat , Ngala Nor ’ dzin directed the process and order of events .
After the lotus petals , the sun and moon were placed .
Then we worked on the khatvangha , making the skulls , flames and tail separately .
Then we assembled Yeshé Tsogyel ’ s robes , face and hat .
Lama Nor ’ dzin was particularly pleased with the attention to detail .
The face of Yeshé Tsogyel had been embroidered in Nepal to Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche ’ s specific design .
However we needed to add lengths of hair to the appliqué .
Sang ##AT##-##AT## gyé plaited ribbon hair extensions and included some strands of hair from Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen , and from Kyabjé Chhi ’ mèd Rig ’ dzin Rinpoche in the plaits .
There was one memorable moment , when everyone thought we had really practically finished the appliqué .
Mmmm … I think we might need to double that braid to get the right effect .
This was towards the end of the last day , and some apprentices – being tired – insisted that the single width looked fine .
However , Ngala Nor ’ dzin was not convinced , and so Naljorma Rin ’ dzin dashed out to her car and sped down to the haberdashers to buy another length before they closed .
On her return a second row of braid was carefully sewn next to the first on the edges of the shawl .
But no – Ngala Nor ’ dzin felt that the blue of the central stripe of the shawl was not quite the right blue and we had to embroider over it with a better colour .
Finally all agreed that these extra efforts did made a substantial difference and added to our experience of finishing the appliqué with a real sense of accomplishment .

This is an hotel for smoking people ( I think like all the hotels in andorra ) .I &apos;ll appreciate a non smoking area the next time .
El hotel nos ha gustado mucho , los salones son muy bonitos y acogedores.La habitación que nos dieron , una doble con balcón y con vistas a las pistas era muy bonita , un poco pequeña pero confortable .

Great hotel with extremely friendly staff !
The high standard of the suit , the calm and no noise and the modern technology of using the paid internet for minuts used rather than counting the time from the first log in .
The staff , the rooms big enough for a family with a young child . The location is also excellent .

I am thinking booking in this hotel again the next time I will be in &quot; Cyprus &quot; .
the service was unfriendly as i have said above ; the breakfast dreadful and unappetising .
completely lack lustre. we wont be back .
The Hotel is basic and the staff helpful and all spoke good English .
Useful location , 5 minute walk to the local fish restaurants , and beach . The Hotel has a smallish swimming pool ( no complaints ) lovely for a quick dip &amp; sun ##AT##-##AT## bathing .
For a short inexpensive stay , I recommend the Cactus , you won &apos;t get the frills of a large Hotel , but who cares , when even breakfast was adequate .
Bring your own shampoo and liquid soap , or buy in the local minimarket .
There wasn &apos;t a minibar in the room which is a must in all hot locations - I suggest that the Hotel up their price to provide a minibar or at least rent ##AT##-##AT## out minibars to guests that want them .
Staff didnt really care about all the things that were wrong with the room . Generally the hotel is run down and the other ones in the area for the same price looked much nicer .

Faults common to many budget hotels in Germany , like : too big and too soft pillows , curtains not so thick to shade morning light , walls so thin you could hear every worker get up and get ready at 7 a.m. ( I think my room was next to somebody &apos;s else toilet ) .
Also : average buffet for those who enjoy continental breakfast , but lousy for latinos like me who just have a croissant or a slice of cake in the morning ( not a single one offered ! ) .
It was very close to messe exchibition , clean and small ##AT##-##AT## frendly .
I was expecting the breakfast to have more choices of sweet staff , or even fresh squeezed juices .
Very helpful and nice staff both at the reception and in the breakfast .
Good breakfast but also some warm items would be nice .. Hotel is well situated .

Other than its location which seems more in an industrial park it was a great hotel .
hotel was booked because of shuttle service - time of required service was confirmed at time of booking but upon arrival , this service was not available .
the reason why most people stay at airport hotels is because of flight times are early morning. there is no point offering this service if it is so limited .
I took the room for the proposed shuttle service but this service only goes to the airport or next train station from 8 am to 5 pm which did not suit me .
Just perfect . Room very large and very clean , wonderful bed , good service , and free internet .

This was a great surprise and I will stay again .
While I expected a relatively small room , I was surprized to find that with a twin booking , we were in a room with two tiny beds , not even normal single width , right up against each other , ie it was in reality a std double bed , with a ridge down the middle .
When booking a twin room I would expect 2 std width single beds , either separate or together .
Blankets on the top of the be were not freshly washed .
The single room was really nice . It was totally new .
When I arrived minibar was not working.They repaired it the next day.TV very small .
Its location is good , very close to main station .

Posizione ottima per visitare la città . Due minuti a piedi per arrivare al Trocadero .
Closeness to the Eiffel Tower and thats about all !
The pictures were not what the hotel presented in true life . The stairs were dangerous , as well as the elevator .
I was overall very displeased and felt I over spent for what they had to offer . We were with a few other people who also rented rooms , we had to argue about everything .
They had us booked longer than we planned , which made the billing inaccurate . They had the wrong type of rooms available for us compared to what we reserved and wwhen I asked questions refering to their actual website and what its amenities were they were unsure of it .
The room was nice , clean , little bit small but enough to stay over night .
Close to Eifel Tower and Arc the Triumpf .
10 min to Eiffel tower on foot . Close to almost any of the historical and shopping places .
Elevator is too small for two people with their baggages . Night watchmen is not so friendly .
Room size , elevator , huge key to be carried around the city !

The hotel staff were very helpful .
Breakfast and room very nice and clean .
Little natural light in the room ( this may not apply to all rooms ) , however this didn &apos;t bother us too much .
Internet should be available everywhere ( guest rooms ) and should be free or at least less expensive . In nowdays , Internet is essential in both work and leisure trips , and paying to access the Internet using small paper cards with passwords is a thing of the 20th century , not acceptable in 2009 .
Old Florence charm with clean , chic decoration which suited the age and style of the building . We had a room which adjoined to one next door with our sons , but still afforded privacy .
Cereals , fruit , ham , cheese and scrambled eggs . Coffee came pre ##AT##-##AT## made in a flask - not what one expects in a hotel of this calibre .
One thing that always buffles me about europe city trips . There are no tea / coffee making facilities in the room .

I would classify this hotel as a business hotel . Not many places to eat around the hotel which makes it difficult w / young kids .
The staff were quite accommodating of the fact that we had a lot of luggage ( we were returning home after 4 year in the Netherland ) .
Shuttle bus service is not like other hotels in schiphol ( 24 / 7 and free of charge ! ) . If you arrive at 1.30 Am and you expect a shuttlebus it is terrible there is no shuttlebus .
ridicolous.Also it costs an extra 20 Euro for a taxi ! ! On the website is written : Holiday Inn Amsterdam Schiphol has a private airport shuttle service .

Sentralt . Moderne rom med det vi trengte .
Tilgang til internett i resepsjon og kaffeautomat . Mindre støy enn forventet for et så sentrumsnært hotell .

Great economy hotel ! Wonderful location , safe and very close to Lisbon &apos;s attractions ; also , many cafes and restaurants nearby , so no need to search for a nice place to eat .
The breakfast was very poor , both regarding quality and quantity .
Location was very close to a lot of things : metro / tram access , restaurants / fast food / pastry shops , shopping areas .
Hotel was clean and lobby was spacious . Breakfast was included and quality of coffee / cocoa / food was good .
Very close to all the sights .
Staff was very helpful when needing information .
Noise coming from halls through the doors .
Breakfast basic ( but acceptable given price ) . Street noise from late night revellers / early deliveries may be an issue for front facing rooms ( though not particularly for me ) .
Overall very convenient and excellent value for money .
The hotel is very well situated , within walking distance of the main attractions , 100 metres from a metro station and near plenty of bars and restaurants . Staff were generally helpful and multilingual .
Breakfast was included , but was so bad that we decided to go somewhere else on the second day . Rooms facing the street can be noisy , and they can feel very small if you are staying more than one or two days ...
The breakfast was quite mediocre but to be fair was included in the excellent price of the room .
The location of the hotel is excellent , on a pedestrianised street , where you can walk straight to the city centre .
The hotel is in a great location , the triple room was very good , we got a good breakfast and all for just over € 30 each per night ! ! great value .
We had a large room our friends a smaller one both were good.Continental breakfast was very good.Recommended.

very nice , very friendly very clean , very cheap ! ! ! !
We got to the hotel around 8am after arriving via the Hotel Train from Madrid and were graciously able to check in early since the room was free . It was a life ##AT##-##AT## saver to be able to catch a little more sleep and take a shower .
Not for our use , but I will note the hotel is up a few flight of stairs with no elevator-- fine for us but could be difficult for others .
Hot water did last very long at all - not even 5 minutes .
The staff were very friendly &amp; helpful . It was also located in the heart of the city .
The stuff is actually not very friendly and not professional . We didn &apos;t feel welcomed there .
The rooms and bed covers could have been cleaner .
Everything - small rooms , terrible and small beds , poor shared bathroom facilities , and very simple , small things that could be easily fixed but that were missing such as shower heads , faucets , and more .
Location of hotel , it was in city center .
The Hotel is really in the centre of Lisbon and its easy to find and quite nice place to stay there for a few days .
The rooms don &apos;t have any heating systems .
Plus our room had a broken window unable to close .
Lack of heating can be a serious problem if not uncomfortable if stayed during the wintertime .
I wouldn &apos;t recommend it as there are a number of nice hostels providing same facilities for similar prices ...
Very well located . Nice and helpful staff .

You don &apos;t need to be in Budapest long to realise that you never know quite where you stand – and that &apos;s not because of the street layout .
Everywhere you look , there is evidence of a city that has been brought to its knees – and restored to its former glory – time and time again .
Even today , it is littered with Roman remains , Turkish baths and Gothic and Baroque architecture , as well as elaborate secessionist ( Hungary ’ s take on Art Nouveau ) facades .
But visiting Budapest is not just about discovering the past , it is also an opportunity to witness a city building its own bright future .
Then it &apos;s on to the real sightseeing .
Must ##AT##-##AT## see landmarks include Europe &apos;s largest Synagogue , the Szent István Basilica and the Buda Royal Palace – not to mention the Széchenyi Lánchíd ( Chain Bridge ) and the dramatic statue of St Gellért , perched above Erzsébet híd ( Elizabeth Bridge ) .
The long walk down the majestic Andrássy út ends at Hősök tere ( Heroes &apos; Square ) , an extravagant monument to Hungary &apos;s key historical figures , and Városliget ( City Park ) , which boasts a host of attractions of its own .
Budapest is not just a city of stunning buildings – many of its museums serve to highlight a history that is proud and unfortunate in equal measure .
The imposing National Museum is impossible to miss , and the chilling House of Terror – the building used by both the Nazi and Communist secret police – is impossible to ignore .
The city is also packed with clubs , concert venues and festivals for music of every possible genre – For 28 years now the Budapest Spring Festival has been Hungary &apos;s biggest cultural festival .
The series of events is of international significance , too .
It is noted in all countries ; travel agencies receive the planned programme months in advance .
In the last two weeks of March around 200 events await Hungarian and foreign tourists in 50 ##AT##-##AT## 60 venues in Budapest .
Besides classical and pop music concerts , there are theatre performances , film screenings , open ##AT##-##AT## air programmes and other festival ##AT##-##AT## type events .
And not far from the traffic and noise of downtown Pest , Margitsziget ( Margaret Island ) is a hub for outdoor activities , and the tranquil hills of Buda are a haven for cyclists , walkers and families .
And who could forget the relaxing and healing properties of the city &apos;s spas .
We are available from monday to saturday from 8.30 until 23.00 on + 31 ( 0 ) 38 ##AT##-##AT## 333 01 01 .

A variation on popular games Acey ##AT##-##AT## Deucey and In ##AT##-##AT## Between , the premise of Red Dog is simple .
The dealer first places two cards from a deck of 52 face ##AT##-##AT## up on the table .
The player must guess whether the value of a randomly selected third card will fall between the values of these two cards .
The narrower the spread between the cards , the more the hand pays !
The value of any card from 2 to 10 counts at face value , a jack counts as 11 , a queen as 12 , a king as 13 , and an ace counts as 14 .
To begin a game , first decide on the table ’ s limits .
These can be found in the drop ##AT##-##AT## down menu beside the Table Games menu . Choose your limit size .
Before the first cards are dealt , you must place an initial wager by choosing and clicking on the desired amount .
Once you &apos;ve placed the amount , press the &quot; Deal &quot; button to see the first two cards .
A marker will be placed on the table to indicate the spread between the two cards , and the corresponding possible payout of the hand .
If a non ##AT##-##AT## consecutive hand has been dealt , you will have the option to &quot; Raise &quot; and double your wager , or just &quot; Stand &quot; and see a third card dealt with no bet increase .
When the dealer draws two cards of the same value , it is known as a “ Pair Hand . ” When this happens , the dealer will automatically draw a third card .
If the third card is the same as the first two , the payout is eleven times your wager .
If the third card does not match , the hand is a tie and your original wager is returned .
If the value of the two cards drawn by the dealer are consecutive ( for example : a 10 and a Jack ) this is called a &quot; Consecutive Hand &quot; .
In this case , the dealer will not draw a third card , the hand is declared a tie and your original wager is returned .
Payouts in Red Dog are based on the probability of the third card falling between the initial two .

Welcome to the Homepage of the German ##AT##-##AT## Danish Cross ##AT##-##AT## Border Air Rescue project .
This pilot project is the first cross ##AT##-##AT## border cooperative initiative between Germany and Denmark in the field of airborne rescue .
Its aim is to establish an economically workable and long ##AT##-##AT## lasting air rescue service in the German ##AT##-##AT## Danish border region .
The German ##AT##-##AT## Danish Cross ##AT##-##AT## Border Air Rescue Service is a reliable and fast emergency resource for citizens on both sides of the border .
In Denmark this is the first time that an air rescue service of this kind has become available .
The main partners in the project are : on the German side , the DRF Air Rescue and the administrative district Nordfriesland , and on the Danish side , the rescue service operator FALCK and the region Syddanmark ( until 2006 : administrative district Sønderjyllands amt ) .
In addition there are other partners from the areas of health services and politics .
within the INTERREG III A Sønderjylland ##AT##-##AT## Schleswig programme .
The project &quot; cross ##AT##-##AT## border air rescue &quot; ended in June 2008 after three years of working time . The project steering committee summarised experiences , results and perspectives in a Danish ##AT##-##AT## German final report .
Pictures and interviews of partners make the brochure comprehensible and easy to read – for professionals and everyone who is interested .

Siwa Oasis - &quot; Ammon / Hammon &quot; in Classical antiquity - is situated on the far side of Egypt &apos;s &quot; Western Desert &quot; , some 80km from the border with Libya and 300km south of Marsa Matruh on the Mediterranean coast .
Extending an average of 17m below sea level the depression is characterized by large expanses of water and &quot; Inselbergs &quot; .
One of the latter ( Qarat A. , with spring ) carries the acropolis and the Temple of the Oracle , while a &quot; contra temple &quot; ( UB .
) is situated on a low rise amongst the palm groves below , some 400m further south .
It is not before the Eg . Late Period ( Amasis , 570 ##AT##-##AT## 525 BC ) that Siwa emerges from historical obscurity , called Santar , a Libyco ##AT##-##AT## Eg .
Famous throughout the Mediterranean world on account of its Eg.-style oracle and the visit Alexander the Great had paid to god Amun , Siwa goes unmentioned in sources from the Nile valley . Till Roman times the oasis remained a sovereign &quot; sheikh ##AT##-##AT## dom &quot; ruled by a Libyan tribal chief ( &quot; basileus &quot; ) .
Cultural ties to neighboring Egypt probably existed long before the 26 .
Dyn . , yet &quot; business wise &quot; ( promoting Siwa as a place of pilgrimage and desert trade ) the oasis shared common interests with Greeks .
During the 1st cent . AD , finally , the &quot; nomus hammoniacus &quot; became part of Roman Egypt .
In Byzantine times it belonged to the dioceses of the Libyan eparchy . Known to the Arabs by its indigenous Name ( Santariya ) , the oasis first ( 708 BC ) swatted all attempts to conquer it .
Not until the middle of the 12th cent. did Islam gain a foot ##AT##-##AT## hold there .
In 1792 W. H. Browne &quot; rediscovered &quot; the oasis initiating a flurry of visits on the part of European travelers as well as scholarly fascination with the ancient oracle that lasted for a century .
Drawings and maps of archaeological value , however , are limited to the temple of UB . , then in a much better state of preservation and the only site accessible .
In 1900 the Egyptologist G. Steindorff was the first to record the relief &apos;s and texts and to establish as fact that the ruins on A. were those of the famous Temple of the Oracle .
To him and the architects H. Ricke and H. Aubin we owe the first historic and architectural details emerging from in situ . Subsequently , it was the Eg .
archaeologist A. Fakhry who greatly improved upon our knowledge of the site and who in the early 1970s had the Temple of the Oracle cleared of surrounding and intrusive dwellings .
At the beginning of the project a general topographic map of the archaeological site was drawn up as well as a map showing the geological stratigraphy of the temple mound . Excavations centered first on UB . , later moved towards the &quot; dromos &quot; -area between this temple and A.
Clearance work in the Temple of the Oracle dealt with the remains of modern debris and intrusive buildings until reaching the bedrock . The building has seen a detailed recording of its architectural features and of the distribution of stone material traced to different quarries as well as charting an assessment of damages ( erosion , salt ) .
to keep the building from falling off the cliff - reversible temporary emergency measures were introduced initially comprised of steel supports . Meanwhile , the latter have been replaced as much as possible by moderate , unobtrusive invasive steps permanently securing the endangered parts of the monument and bedrock .
Currently , preparations are under way to excavate ( 1 .
) the ( hypothetical ) palace area bordering the Temple of the Oracle to the west , ( 2 . ) the underground passage serving the palace &apos;s need for water from the nearby holy well ( Diodorus ) and ( 3 .
) the depression extending in ##AT##-##AT## between the well and the former pylon of the temple &apos;s fore ##AT##-##AT## court .
A feasibility study concerning the extension of stabilizing measures to other areas of the temp ##AT##-##AT## le mound is ready for submission to the Supreme Council of Antiquities . If finance can be secured the project could go ahead immediately .
The site map was produced photogrammetrically based on aerial photographs obtained from a hot ##AT##-##AT## air balloon ( Zeppelin ) .
Photogrammetry was also used for obtaining elevations of most of the walls of the Temple of the Oracle . All plans underwent correction by hand and were then digitized .
Excavations were surveyed using a total station ( computerized theodolite ) for generating plans , which were again manually corrected , digitized and finished in AutoCAD .
Measures directed towards strengthening and preserving the bedrock and temple walls on A. centered on the insertion of pre ##AT##-##AT## tensed rock- and intra mural ##AT##-##AT## anchors .
Pertinent studies ( stress engineering , geology , mineralogy ) served as scientific basis for the work .
Mineral materials employed in restoration were chosen in accordance with ancient building materials .
Technical details derived from the study of the masonry of the Temple of the Oracle ( opus pseudo ##AT##-##AT## isdomomum , claw ##AT##-##AT## chisel marks , type of anathyrosis , lewis holes ) reveal unequivocally that the Ammonians employed Greek rather than Egyptian builders . Surprisingly , however , joints and the rubble filling of stretcher courses are cemented together using a liquid mortar of anhydrite ( gypsum ) , thus achieving extraordinary sturdiness in conjunction with the walls &apos; bedrock foundations .
Therefore , partitioning walls have been tied into lateral walls only here and there at unspecific courses , trusting that regular bonding could be avoided . The basic plan ( forecourt &gt; ( pseudo- ) pronaos &gt; two halls &gt; holy of holies ) , architectural sculpturing ( fluted columns , cavetto cornice , torus ) as well as the decoration of the temple ( figures of Eg .
example . Concerning the &quot; secret chamber &quot; above the holy of holies accessible only from the roof by means of a ladder in a concealed corridor , the arrangement appears to meet the requirements of oracles proceeding behind closed doors as they were originally devised for the Eg .
At the foot of the acropolis and in direct line with its gate a stretch of ashlar masonry has been excavated that aims straight for UB . A bit further to the south , excavations yielded the remains of the ( ashlar ) foundations of another building , inscribed with Greek mason marks and positioned at right angles to the hypothetical dromos .
Registry Trash Keys Finder ( TrashReg ) is an advanced Registry cleaning tool .
The main function of RTKF is to allow the removal of unnecessary keys from the Windows Registry .
Many programs leave keys in the Registry , even after programs removal using an uninstallation facility provided with the programs themselves .
RTKF allows you to decide whether to delete or leave the keys found .
An additional effect ( it may be the main aim for some users ) of removal of these keys is the &quot; revival &quot; of some programs trial versions after the initial trial period has expired .
The oldest review of TrashReg was made by Softoogle editors a couple years ago .
You can find this review here .
Registry Trash Keys Finder requires a PC running Windows 95 / 98 / ME / 2000 / XP / 2003 / Vista .

Actually there are two different versions of Registry Trash Keys Finder .
The first one is the Freeware version that can be freely downloaded from my website or from other software download sites .
The second one is the Full version .
There are a few important additional searches not fully implemented in the Freeware version .
Full version is not available for free downloading and at the moment it requires making a personal contribution for TrashReg project further development .
By some signs the Full version of Registry Trash Keys Finder can be likened to DonationWare software .
DonationWare is software where you give to the author what you think his software is worth .
The author gives you a few suggestions of what , he humbly thinks , deserves for further development of his program but you have the final word , absolutely .
I must admit that I sometimes wonder why I &apos;m spending hours adding more features to RTKF .
Or why I &apos;m translating every version into English .
There are several reasons , and money is one of them .
I have expenses for developing and distributing RTKF : backup CD ##AT##-##AT## ROM &apos;s , domain name , expensive internet access , ink , paper , bread and butter , coffee and a lot of Russian Vodka ( of course it &apos;s a joke : - ) ) ...

In the course of the controversy over the Danish caricatures , the grand imam of the influential Al ##AT##-##AT## Azhar ##AT##-##AT## University in Cairo suggested a worldwide ban on the injury of religious sensibilities .
This was to be based on a law drafted by leading representatives of the religions of the world , including himself and Pope Benedict XVI .
This bizarre suggestion acts like a concentrate of the contemporary situation .
Alone the idea that religious leaders could draft a legal text is like an echo from long ##AT##-##AT## gone theocracies .
Also interesting is the ecumenical approach , which clearly does not anticipate inter ##AT##-##AT## religious offence , but only that caused by secularized individuals .
However , most bizarre is the way the imam &apos;s seemingly anachronistic suggestion , in its complete misconception of the Western world , unintentionally reveals a truth about our present – a truth that , paradoxically , also feeds the fundamental misunderstandings of the current debate .
In order to approach this complex state of affairs , we should first of all bear in mind the incredible revival the concept of religious sensibility has undergone since the start of the cartoon controversy .
Unnoticed , it has taken centre stage in the public sphere .
The reception it has enjoyed there is all the more remarkable for the fact that this public has constituted itself precisely through the elimination of all subjectivities .
The Italian philosopher Paolo Flores d &apos;Arcais has dealt with this development in a recent text .
In it , he shows religious sensibility in its role as opponent of freedom : my freedom should not end where your sensibility begins , he writes .
However , the latter manages to gain entry – through the back door as it were – as a caveat that infiltrates the individual , whose ethics of responsibility it mobilizes , thereby developing its effect as self ##AT##-##AT## censor , as a kind of super ##AT##-##AT## ego , that forbids itself any action that could be interpreted as provocation .
D &apos;Arcais clearly rejects the aspirations of religious sensibility to a position in the public sphere .
According to him , this is because faith is not an absolute in the public sphere , since in democracy the latter is &quot; inviolably pluralistic &quot; .
As much as d &apos;Arcais is to be agreed with in an ethical sense , it must be said that this attitude – which could be called the Western attitude # 1 – is insufficient .
The complexity of the contemporary situation consists among other things in it not being enough simply to adopt a stance .
In doing so , d &apos;Arcais &apos;s analysis overlooks an essential political change .
The delimitation that underlies his argumentation between the public sphere and privacy within a civil society underwent a major alteration a long time ago .
As opposed to the former premise , according to which one had to get rid of one &apos;s particularities in order to enter the public sphere , this step is now taken precisely in the name of private identity .
One receives public attention precisely on account of one &apos;s singularity , as such becoming part of the social whole : as woman , as homosexual , and now as someone with religious sensibilities .
As the French theorist of democracy Marcel Gauchet concludes , civil society is &quot; going public &quot; , while the state is &quot; going private &quot; .
The imam unintentionally illustrated this change .
This has major effects upon the public discourse of our societies .
In this way specific demands are no longer hedged in a political language – for example , they are no longer formulated into a programme .
It is rather a matter of influencing the political by means of an unequivocally apolitical language , a &quot; language of ethical demands &quot; ( Gauchet ) .
Thus the public sphere becomes increasingly substantialized : it is confronted with values supposed to govern it .
As if under a magnifying glass , it is exactly this development that can be observed in the cartoon controversy .
The person with religious sensibilities has not formulated his demand for recognition in a political language , calling for example for an improvement in the situation for migrants .
It is much more that he or she has &quot; gone public &quot; in their religious feelings and sought confirmation as such .
&#91; 1 &#93; One must therefore see that this discourse , which d &apos;Arcais so decisively opposes , could only &quot; take hold &quot; because it met with a disposition of our changed public space , one that promotes such positions .
The cartoon controversy fell on fertile ground .
For the Western attitude # 1 , then , it becomes apparent that it is no longer sufficient to combat this discourse with the long ##AT##-##AT## since invalid concept of a public sphere .
However now there is another Western attitude # 2 , one of understanding for the Islamic world .
Here , however , the attitude is based on mistaken recognition .
Its understanding is based on a fundamental misunderstanding .
This becomes obvious when one asks oneself whether or not these phenomena , which occupy the public worldwide , is now a &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; .
This question is all the more difficult to answer , when even talking about such a clash can be anti ##AT##-##AT## Islamic .
However that would only be the case if one understood by &quot; civilizations &quot; what the originator of this slogan , Samuel Huntington , has – quite rightly – been accused of : the idea that these are fixed cultural units , monolithic blocs , that &quot; naturally &quot; come into conflict with one another .
And the related conviction that the division of the world according to cultural characteristics ( however these may be defined ) necessarily means a hierarchization – in this case , the bolstering of a Western , American dominance , one that is to be defended .
In this sense , the term &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; would in fact be a declaration of war , not an analysis .
Nevertheless , one shouldn &apos;t lay aside this formulation quite so soon if one wants to understand what is going on at the moment .
Thomas Asshauer has written in Die Zeit – in a polemic against Huntington – that religion is &quot; often only a mask &#91; ... &#93; behind which are hidden brutal conflicts of recognition and defence &quot; .
However that seems to be exactly where a fundamental misunderstanding arises .
The idea that religion is merely an irrational mask for an underlying rationality means not to take religion seriously .
It recalls the characterization of religion as a &quot; superstructural phenomenon &quot; that must lead back to its real basis .
In reducing Islam like this , one passes up the chance of understanding the specific function that it has today .
This is no mask behind which to hide other truths such as poverty , exploitation , or lack of opportunities : rather – and precisely because of these problems – it is far more the field in which identity is generated .
An identity that no longer restricts itself to national borders , but that answers to a transnational , pan ##AT##-##AT## Islamic call , that Muslims from Turkey to Pakistan can follow .
The importance of this function of religious belief becomes clear if one bears in mind the following : of course all these conflicts really exist – however , despite their overbearing reality , they are not carried over into social or economic conflicts .
The field in which they are played out and &quot; fought over &quot; is religion or culture .
Not only is that something different than a mask , it is its opposite .
Religion can take on this function only when its meaning is fundamentally altered .
Here , it is not religion in the sense of piety or holy experience that is being contemporized .
The appeal to religion becomes something polemic , something that is set against others , in order to challenge an equally imaginary Other – the West .
Therefore , the oft ##AT##-##AT## discussed question of how far Muslims are united in their faith , or which schisms , as indices of a rational distance , might exist , is ultimately irrelevant .
Because here religion no longer functions primarily as a reference to a transcendence , but as the generation of community , an identity in other words , that is directed against something .
It becomes a field on which the losers of globalization can unite .
It is precisely this shift that is overlooked by the Western attitude # 2 that believes it recognizes its liberal , privatist understanding of religion in the cartoon controversy .
But the conflict , with its understandable but also with its disproportionate reactions , has shown that the demand for respect for religious conviction turns into its opposite , and that religion – which is precisely not privatized – can become a means to challenge the liberal West .
The sacred becomes a banner under which Muslims worldwide can unite against the West .
In this sense , one is obliged to say that Huntington is right , religion is the ideological form in which conflicts with the West are fought .
So Huntington is then right if one understands &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; as the &quot; clash of cultural ideologies &quot; .
Of course , culturizing the conflict in this way is playing with fire .
But those who warn of this fail to recognize that such a process has already occurred .
The character of the conflict has long since shifted from a secular , social ##AT##-##AT## economic level to a religious , fundamentalist one .
This shift is synonymous with the change from rational conflicts , which ultimately appear to be quantifiable , and therefore divisible and solvable , to cultural ##AT##-##AT## loading , which turns these into identitarian conflicts .
What we are witnessing is not an irrational masking of rational problems , but far more that the conflict itself has become irrational .
The reason for this is what could be called &quot; terrorist totalitarianism &quot; .
Not only has terrorism dissociated the terrain of battle from every rational and negotiable level .
It has also brought about an unbelievable extension of the conflict , whereby it not only involves in the cultural ##AT##-##AT## religious conflict those who want such a thing , but also draws in those who do not .
It compels moderates to identify themselves as Muslims , and thus – whether intentionally or not – to join its ranks .
The differentiation between radicals and moderates thus becomes increasingly loose .
More and more sectors of the population are brought in – as the cartoon conflict has been exemplary in showing .
Where exactly do the boundaries between Islam and Islamism , which all liberals evoke , run ?
Terrorist totalitarianism also explains why the much invoked &quot; dialogue &quot; of cultures does not help , since this sets liberalism as a prerequisite not only for the interlocutor , but for the field in which such a dialogue may occur in the first place .
With religious identity , however , Islamism has from the start placed itself on another terrain : it has not only made religion the stake of the conflict , it has also made it the medium through which that conflict is waged .
However here lies the crux of the Western attitude # 1 , which , when answering the central question in this conflict of which is more important to us , the values of the Enlightenment or those of religion , opts unequivocally for the former .
Because it fails to recognize that this question rests on false grounds : it allows in answer only a declaration of faith – regardless of which of the two alternatives one opts for .
However , the moment the so ##AT##-##AT## called &quot; West &quot; treats democracy – which is in fact a specific form of a faithless faith – like a faith , when it begins to defend its order as if it were an article of faith , it has followed its opponent onto his own side of the net : into the irrationality of a battle of faith .
This totalitarian game can &apos;t be won – it can only be rejected .

&#91; 1 &#93; The imam &apos;s demand for a legal stipulation – which is indeed indebted to the rubric &quot; theocracy &quot; – would catch up with him , however : the legal protection of the individual believer in his or her subjective feelings would result in his flock breaking up into individuals .
The Roman orator Cicero wrote that &quot; not to know history is to be always a child &quot; . But are those who know history necessarily more grown ##AT##-##AT## up ?
Cicero doesn &apos;t say . In truth , very few of us , if any , use history to guide our decisions .
The more recent and pressing such experience is , the more zealous our courses of action . For the vast majority , history and its lessons fall by the wayside .
Another problem with direct experience is the fact that it is non ##AT##-##AT## transferable .
The experience of others can be at most a mirror we hold up to our own experience to broaden our perspective .
This concerns the experience of Iraq as well as that of Germany .
At most one can copy this model or that model , something which , in the case of Iraq , has its own story .
In the mid ##AT##-##AT## 1930s , several Arab nationalists developed a political programme whose goal was to fulfil the &quot; eternal mission &quot; of &quot; unity , freedom , and socialism &quot; . As formulated by the chief ideologue of the Baath party , Michel Aflaq , unity was the natural law , the moral and historical necessity that all Arabs live in a single nation state .
To lend support to their concept , Arab nationalists drew on Johann Gottfried von Herder &apos;s statements about the mind and body of a nation . The mind of the Arab nation is Islam , and its body is Pan Arabism , both coming together to produce continuous revolution .
How this mind and body were ultimately put into practice in Iraq is shown by the nationalist coup led by Rashid &apos; Ali al ##AT##-##AT## Qilani in May 1941 .
Supported militarily by the Nazis , the coup resulted in a nationalist mob storming the Jewish quarters of Baghdad and killing dozens of Jewish citizens – a wild pogrom patterned after the 1938 Reichskristallnacht , the &quot; Night of Broken Glass &quot; .
This tragic event was subsequently known in modern Iraqi history by the notorious term Farhud al ##AT##-##AT## Yahud , the looting of the Jews .
The pogrom brutally demonstrated the close ties between Nazi Germany and Arab Nationalists . From the meeting between Amin al ##AT##-##AT## Hussaini , the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , and Adolf Hitler to the ultra ##AT##-##AT## national regime of Saddam Hussein , one sees repeated examples of a German ##AT##-##AT## Arab pact .
However much the nationalist systems in Germany and Iraq differed due to societal structures , they were perfectly identical in their battle against political heterogeneity . Each imposed a Gleichschaltung leading to ethnic and religious persecution of minorities , the dissolution of leftwing parties and liberal forces , rigid cultural control , the militarization of society , and , in the end , wars of extermination .
Yet compared with Germany &apos;s impressive postwar development , the situation in Iraq post Saddam Hussein seems bleak .
Iraq is a country rich in history and culture , a country that continuously sought and found new forms of expression , a country that laid the basic principles of the Western and Eastern worlds .
It was the country of trade that invented the written language ; it was the country where poetry , storytelling , numbers , mathematics , astronomy , medicine , art , music , laws , and myth began ; it was the origin of religious scripture , the cradle of the prophet . But despite these material and intellectual riches , Iraq has become a country of chronic suffering .
Its people lack basic resources ; massive human rights violations and matchless repressions abound ; armed conflict , sanctions , looting , and environmental destruction are the order of the day ; its people have been traumatized through terror , forced into flight , and killed in senseless static warfare . Though Iraq can boast of a great diversity of identities and languages , it has remained a place of bloody ethnic and nationalist confrontation .
For all of its modern troubles , however , Iraq has had its own experiences with democracy . And as it happens , these experiences occurred at nearly the same time as Germany &apos;s first attempts to establish a democracy , during the Weimar Republic .
On 11 March 1917 , the British army , under the command of General Frederick Maude , marched into Baghdad and cleared out the remaining Ottoman garrisons , thus ending four centuries of rule in the name of Islam . After Turkey &apos;s capitulation in 1918 , the British declared that a freely elected national government in Iraq was one of its objectives .
Though General Maude announced emphatically that he had come to liberate , not to conquer , most Iraqis remained sceptical . The British colonialists attempted to garner support from those Iraqi groups that were willing to cooperate , promising them high positions in the military administration .
But the rural populations and the religious clergy were not persuaded by these conciliatory offerings and adamantly rejected the occupation .
Their bitter resistance to the British army culminated in the major revolt of 1920 , which led the British to appoint an Arab king , create a provisional parliament , and hold general elections . The coronation of Faisal I on 23 August 1921 – in which the British played a decisive role – marked the start of democratization in Iraq .
Faisal was received enthusiastically by the people of Baghdad and the Iraqi elite , and the British regarded it as a veritable coup . But very quickly a strange political constellation emerged .
On the one hand were idealistic British government officials interested in questions of human rights ; on the other hand were corrupt colonial administrators in cahoots with similarly corrupt Iraqis . The gradually disillusioned Iraqi political elite decided to give their support to the latter .
The fact there was corruption ought not to overshadow the achievements of the time .
The British occupation brought with it major changes in people &apos;s lives as well as a new set of economic , social , and political values .
One of the greatest accomplishments was the abolishment of the veil , brought about by noted politicians and intellectuals , as well as ( most importantly ) women themselves .
Also during this time , the first parties , unions , and associations were established ; Iraqi literature , the so ##AT##-##AT## called New Classicism , reached its high point ; and music , theatre , and visual arts experienced an impressive renaissance after a long period of prohibition under Ottoman rule .
It was widely feared that Britain would not make good on its promise to grant Iraq its independence . Many suspected that former Iraqi officers close to King Faisal and on friendly terms with the Mandate forces were receiving preferential treatment so as to secure treaties and contracts favourable to the British .
Four years later , King Faisal , the founder of modern Iraq , died and was succeeded by his twenty ##AT##-##AT## one ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old son , Gazi . Consumed by a deep hatred toward the British – they had betrayed his grandfather Scharif Hussain of Mekka and had disappointed his own father , Faisal – Gazi lacked a clear political vision , and the situation in Iraq under his rule became increasingly instable .
In 1936 , the Chief of Staff of the Iraqi army , Bakr Sudqi – a person already notorious for his brutal military campaigns against the Assyrians in the North and the Arab tribes in the South – responded with a coup d &apos;etat . Three years later , the young King Gazi was killed in a car accident , and the Iraqis immediately blamed the English for his murder .
Thinking that these developments could threaten their own interests , the British pressured their Iraqi allies to renew the Treaty of 1930 , the Anglo ##AT##-##AT## Iraqi agreement that provided supposed independence for the Iraqis . The new treaty , signed in Portsmouth in 1948 , triggered a large protest , which the British violently put down .
Instead of carefully establishing democratic measures , the powers that be in Iraq did the exact opposite : parliament was suspended , opposition parties were outlawed , their papers banned , and martial law was imposed .
In this climate , volatile military officers , including Abdul Karim Qassim and Abdul Salam Muhammad Arif , became national heroes . On 14 July 1958 , these free officers seized power , expelled the British army , and deposed the monarchy .
Nearly the entire family of the king was executed in their Palace of Roses and the most powerful ally of the British , Nuri as ##AT##-##AT## Said , was dragged through the streets of Baghdad , after which his body was dismembered and set on fire .
As a whole , it is correct to claim that democracy is a decisive and necessary form of government for a developed industrial society . Democracy can find a basis consensus among the antagonistic and diverse interests of varying groups , peacefully resolving conflicts and promoting society &apos;s continued development .
The problem has to do with the absence of democratic cornerstones . Countries such as Bangladesh , Indonesia , or Pakistan – places where even secular women have held power – are in great danger due to the enormous economic problems faced by their ancient and nomadic societies .
A decisive factor for practicing democracy is the degree to which a nation is organized or can be organized . Without firm organization , no decisions or checks can be carried out .
&quot; Umar , the Islamic Caliph , will now destroy me &quot; , Rustan is reported to have said , &quot; for he is teaching the dogs how to behave . &quot; Today , of course , this organizational potential is not being utilized for technical revolutions , but for brutal Islamic terror .
The most important components of a democracy – the constitutional state , free elections , and freedom of the press – remained empty ideas in Iraq . Although Iraq never lacked proponents of democracy , the anti ##AT##-##AT## democratic forces were always a step ahead .
With organized opposition weak and plagued by in ##AT##-##AT## fighting , its members could easily be side ##AT##-##AT## stepped , intimidated , exiled , or , as in the case of communist leaders in 1949 , executed without trial .
A decisive point ignored in most discussions of Iraq is the absence of the concept of &quot; citizen &quot; . In Iraq , the citizen was replaced by the subject on whom the will of the state imposed itself .
Everything that the state gave was a mere donation ; everything that the state took was its fair toll .
And what about the new wave of democracy in Iraq today ? It hardly needs to be said that the current situation in Iraq is enormously depressing .
For the prevailing model in Iraq is not democratic at all , but absolutely anti ##AT##-##AT## democratic , with its lining of orthodox religion from both the Shiite and Sunni camps dividing power nearly perfectly along confessional lines .
It does not suffice to replace Saddam &apos;s state by one less bad and less corrupt . One needs to do significantly more to take into account the interests of the Iraqi population , to establish a basis from which the legacy of Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime – the confessional and ethnic rifts between Sunni and Shiite , Arab and Kurd – can be overcome .
Though Saddam is no longer in power , his legacy will continue to cast a long shadow , for he systematically destroyed everything on whose basis a democratic Iraq could be built . Iraqis do not have the strength – in case they have any left at all – to rebuild their country .
More urgently than ever , they need massive support from Western democracies in every area of life : safeguarding the national borders , building infrastructure , fighting terror , reducing unemployment , finding internal answers to the nationality question . In addition , the country needs a competent , experienced government to carry out the reconstruction and a diplomatic control apparatus to oversee its implementation .
It needs a basic framework for the organized return of Iraqi exiles and refuges .
It needs general amnesty for all those in Saddam &apos;s regime who did not grossly violate human rights or commit war crimes . And , finally , it is imperative that the idea of a confederation be considered that has Shiite support .
Fortunately , some of these demands have been adopted by Iraqi political parties and included in the new constitution , but Iraq will not become a model of democracy for the Arab and Islamic world overnight . ( It took forty years for the Federal Republic of Germany to convince the East Germans to follow suit .
The debate about prostitution is conducted between two poles .
Abolitionists hold that prostitution exploits women per se and call for the prosecution of the pimps and even customers as a measure against sex slavery and trafficking in human beings .
Liberals hold that sex is a commodity like any other and call for the social recognition and official regulation of prostitution in order to improve prostitutes &apos; working conditions .
Both positions are simplifications , writes Julia O &apos;Connell Davidson .
Any policy genuinely aiming at improving the lives of migrant sex workers must focus on reducing poverty in the countries of origin .
Both feminist and religiously inspired abolitionists have long viewed , and continue to view , male demand for commercial sex as a root cause of prostitution and the abuses that can accompany it ( child sexual exploitation , violence , &quot; trafficking &quot; , abusive and slavery ##AT##-##AT## like employment practices ) .
Until recently , calls to criminalise and reform men who buy sex have often fallen on deaf ears .
Now suddenly , it seems that policy makers are beginning to listen .
Over the past decade , &quot; John Schools &quot; to re ##AT##-##AT## educate men caught kerb ##AT##-##AT## crawling have sprung up in the United States , Canada and the UK .
In 1998 , Sweden introduced legislation that criminalizes the buying of sex .
More particularly , growing international concern about the phenomena of &quot; human trafficking &quot; has encouraged a shift in attitudes and policy responses towards prostitution .
Here too , there is increasing receptivity to the idea that those who consume commercial sex may represent a social problem , for it is frequently asserted that it is the demand for young and foreign prostitutes that makes trafficking into a profitable activity .
So , for example , the Swedish Ombudsman for gender equality , Claes Borgström , called for a boycott of the World Cup in Germany on grounds that it would stimulate demand for prostitution , and therefore lead to an increase in trafficking and sexual slavery ; while the UN Special Rapporteur , Sigma Huda , remarked in her latest report that ³ regular ² prostitution falls within the category of trafficking , and stated that the most efficient means to reduce the demand for trafficking is to criminalize the purchase of sexual services .
More generally , in international policy circles , it is increasingly common to hear talk of the need to address &quot; the demand ##AT##-##AT## side of trafficking &quot; , and a number of research studies on this phenomenon have recently been commissioned .
Though the idea that &quot; sex trafficking &quot; is stimulated by the demand for commercial sexual services has a certain commonsense appeal , this paper argues that questions about the relationship between exploitative and abusive labour practices in the sex sector and the demand for commercial sexual services are rather more complicated than is allowed in dominant anti ##AT##-##AT## trafficking discourse .
What is the demand side of &quot; sex trafficking &quot; ?
Until recently , there was no international agreement as to the proper legal definition of the term &quot; trafficking &quot; .
Following much debate between those with a political stake in the issue , in November 2000 , the UN Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime was adopted by the UN General Assembly , and with it two new protocols , one on smuggling of migrants and one on trafficking in persons – the Protocol to Prevent , Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons , Especially Women and Children .
The recruitment , transportation , transfer , harbouring or receipt of persons , by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion , of abduction , of fraud , of deception , of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person , for the purpose of exploitation .
The Trafficking Protocol entered into force in December 2003 .
By 2004 , it had been signed by 117 countries and it is often assumed to have successfully laid the definitional problems and political divisions associated with the term &quot; trafficking &quot; to rest .
Critics point out that , framed within the Convention on Transnational Organised Crime , and packaged with a Protocol on smuggling , the Trafficking Protocol reflects a preoccupation with &quot; illegal immigration &quot; as part and parcel of a supposed security threat posed by transnational organised crime as opposed to a concern with the human rights of migrants .
&#91; 2 &#93; Furthermore , though it provides a definition of &quot; trafficking &quot; , the protocol leaves undefined many of the constituent elements of what is described as &quot; trafficking &quot; .
So , for example , the terms &quot; sexual exploitation &quot; and &quot; exploitation of the prostitution of others &quot; are not defined .
From one political perspective – which can loosely be termed &quot; abolitionist &quot; – prostitution represents a form of male sexual violence against women .
A market in commercial sexual services is said to necessarily reduce women and girls to mere objects of trade , and thus no distinction can be made between &quot; forced &quot; and &quot; voluntary &quot; prostitution .
A woman cannot volunteer to be dehumanised through prostitution any more than she could meaningfully consent to sell herself into slavery . Viewed through this particular lens , to employ a woman to work as a prostitute is by definition to &quot; exploit &quot; her , and to pay for commercial sexual services is automatically to commit an act of &quot; sexual exploitation &quot; .
Lobby groups that adopt this political perspective therefore insist that the demand for commercial sexual services acts as a stimulus for trafficking – if there were no market for prostitution there would be no trafficking . They are adamant that States should penalise men who buy sex , as well as third parties who organise and / or financially benefit from prostitution .
Needless to say , this position is unacceptable to those at the other end of the political spectrum .
For those who adopt a liberal or libertarian stance on sex commerce , viewing it as little different in moral and political terms from any other market in personal services , the idea that it is necessary to eradicate the entire commercial sex market in order to address the problem of trafficking for prostitution is as draconian and wrong ##AT##-##AT## headed as the idea that it is necessary to eliminate demand for carpets in order to address the problem of forced and child labour in the carpet industry .
Viewed through this lens , questions about the demand side of &quot; trafficking &quot; for prostitution are clearly questions about employer demand for forced labour rather than consumer demand .
Protagonists on both sides of the &quot; sex slavery or sex work &quot; debate often gloss over challenges to their position posed by the body of empirical evidence on prostitution in the contemporary world .
Third party involvement does not map tidily onto the settings from which prostitutes work , and whether involved in &quot; indoor &quot; or &quot; outdoor &quot; prostitution , prostitutes may be controlled by an extremely abusive third party , or working completely independently , or somewhere between these two extremes .
The degree of direct economic exploitation to which prostitutes are exposed thus spans a continuum from absolute ( as when a third party appropriates all of the money garnered through an individual &apos;s prostitution ) to entirely absent ( as when a person who prostitutes independently keeps all of her or his earnings ) .
The term &quot; prostitution &quot; does not refer to a uniform experience . To describe as &quot; sex slavery &quot; the condition of an adult woman who works independently as an escort partly because it satisfies her own personal interest in anonymous sex and partly because she can earn upwards of 2000 Euros per week from it is clearly unsatisfactory , just as it would be unsatisfactory to describe as a &quot; sex worker &quot; a teenager who has been kidnapped , imprisoned and physically forced to prostitute .
Whether we are talking about sex work or any other form of labour , the line between coercion and consent is not and never has been clear ##AT##-##AT## cut . In the absence of alternative opportunities , or where the inducements are great enough , people can and do volunteer to enter contracts that may harm them or that they would not otherwise choose to enter .
In Europe today , opportunities to buy sexual experience across a market are greater and more varied , commercial sexual experience can be consumed legally as well as illegally , and the boundaries between commercial sex and other forms of consumption ( leisure , tourism , entertainment , etc . ) are more blurred .
Does the expansion of this market fuel &quot; trafficking &quot; ? There is no automatic relationship between consumer demand and any specific form of employment relation in the sex industry .
In theory , demand for any given commercial sexual service can just as well be met by someone working independently in good conditions as by someone subject to abusive and slavery ##AT##-##AT## like practices . And yet there are some fairly obvious reasons to expect that the rapid expansion of a market that is poorly regulated , widely stigmatised and partially criminalized will be associated with an increased incidence of abusive labour practices .
In this sense , growing consumer demand is undoubtedly one of the factors contributing to the phenomenon of forced labour in the sex industry . Though it does not follow that all demand is now met by unfree labour ( indeed , viewed as a whole , it is almost certainly the case that the vast bulk of those working in Europe &apos;s sex sector are formally free wage workers or self ##AT##-##AT## employed individuals ) , I believe this does give us legitimate reasons to feel concern about the expansion of demand for commercial sex .
Demand for commercial sex is , like all forms of consumer demand , very much a socially , culturally and historically determined matter . It is also intimately related to questions about supply , availability , and affordability .
There is no absolute or given level of demand for the services of lap ##AT##-##AT## dancers in any society , for example , and before the relatively recent advent of lap dance clubs , no one bemoaned their absence . However , though supply may be a necessary condition for demand , it is not always a sufficient condition .
Demand must also be socially constructed in the sense that people have to be taught to imagine that they want or need a given product or service . Consumption is , as many sociologists and historians have observed , a form of display both in the sense that it is a marker of identity and social status , and also in the sense that it is used to punctuate time , to ritualistically and publicly mark off our passage through the day , the week , the year , our life .
Human beings are not born wishing to buy commercial sexual services or to visit lap dance clubs , for instance , any more than they are born with specific desires to play the lottery or drink coca ##AT##-##AT## cola .
Markets are socially constructed and historically contingent .
As Spillman puts it , the creation of a market involves &quot; the cultural construction of objects of market exchange , the cultural construction of the parties to market exchange , and the cultural construction of norms of exchange &quot; .
&#91; 5 &#93; This insight is just as relevant in relation to the market for prostitution as it is to any other market .
However , each of the three elements of construction are contested in relation to the prostitution market .
To begin with , the idea that the capacity to bring sexual pleasure to another human being can be treated as an alienable object of market exchange is disputed .
Feminist abolitionists , who view prostitution as a form of male sexual violence akin to rape , vigorously reject the idea that sexual services can be detached from the person and sold across a market without harm to the female prostitute .
But it is not just feminist abolitionists who have trouble imagining sexual services as straightforward objects of market exchange , and prostitutes as market actors like any other .
Although prostitution is popularly understood to be a market ( indeed , it is commonly naturalised as such – people speak of it as &quot; the world &apos;s oldest profession &quot; , and say that it is inevitable ) , most people remain either ambivalent about or disapproving of this market .
Certainly , the parties to the market exchange of prostitution are not culturally constructed in the same way that parties to other market exchanges are constructed .
The immense stigma that has traditionally been attached to female prostitution means that women who trade sex are not typically viewed merely as market actors – they are instead widely imagined and represented as sinful , sexually and morally depraved , or as vectors of disease , or as fallen or lost women , damaged victims .
All of these discourses about prostitution persist alongside an increasing sexualisation , even pornogrification , of consumer culture more generally , with very explicit sexual images used in the marketing of all manner of products .
They also co ##AT##-##AT## exist with more traditional boundary ##AT##-##AT## blurrings , for it has long been accepted that an economic value attaches to female sexuality and that this value can and should be realised through marriage to economically successful men .
Women &apos;s sexuality is thus understood , whether implicitly or explicitly , to have an exchange value , and yet it is still not generally regarded as something that can be separated from the person and traded as a commodity in prostitution without moral harm .
As Margaret Radin comments : &quot; Perhaps the best way to characterize the present situation is to say that women &apos;s sexuality is incompletely commodified &quot; .
This incomplete commodification clearly has some very negative consequences for many women who trade sex .
It means that the stigma associated with prostitution continues , and along with it not just a risk of rejection , hostility , even violence from family and community , but also often an inability to access basic rights , including the right to protection and justice .
In many countries , incomplete commodification further means that there is no regulatory regime in place to enforce contracts or protect those who sell sexual services from poor working conditions and exploitative employment relations .
And even in countries where prostitution is legal and regulated , the fact that prostitution is not regarded as a commodity exchange like any other , and that prostitutes are not viewed in the same way as other market actors means that the regulatory regime often imposes constraints and unfreedoms on sex workers that would not be imposed on other groups of workers or citizens .
In effect , incomplete commodificiation means that even where what they do is not actually illegal , prostitutes are excluded from &quot; civil society &quot; understood as &quot; a social , cultural and ethical system made up of the market , the legal system and voluntary associations to promote the welfare of the community &quot; &#91; 8 &#93; and this has very serious consequences for their social status and well being .
One response to this is to argue for the complete commodification of prostitution , in the sense of struggling to ensure that the objects , parties and norms of this market are reframed and understood in the same way as in other &quot; respectable &quot; markets , on grounds that this would make it possible for sex workers to be ethically incorporated into civil society , and so to benefit from full community inclusion .
This is the strategy pursued by many sex worker rights &apos; activists , who call both for the de ##AT##-##AT## stigmatization and decriminalization of prostitution and the application of labour law to the sex sector , arguing that if prostitution were regarded as a respectable , normal market like any other , the norms of exchange would fall into line with those in other legal and socially accepted markets .
It strikes me that this position is overly optimistic about the possibilities for , and potential consequences of , establishing sexual services as socially valued , or even morally neutral , objects of market exchange .
Consumer markets – whether in sex , other personal services , or goods – are sites in which a society &apos;s status hierarchies are reproduced , and this means that inequalities along lines of class , race , nation , age and gender do get played out symbolically and reinforced in practices of consumption .
It is not necessary to be morally conservative , abolitionist , anti ##AT##-##AT## pleasure or sex negative in order to feel uneasy about , say , the emergence of a sizeable market involving West African street workers and white clients in Spain , a country where there are no black female politicians , only a handful of black female professionals , few representations of black women as anything other than domestic workers or prostitutes on television and other media , and where anti ##AT##-##AT## African racism is routinely voiced .
However , the abolitionist response to the problem appears still more dangerous .
Measures to prevent men buying sex from street prostitutes and / or to suppress the most visible forms of prostitution are increasingly presented and justified as &quot; anti ##AT##-##AT## trafficking &quot; measures .
Leaving aside the many objections to such policies that are made by many groups concerned with the safety , human rights and civil liberties of women who work in street prostitution , it is clear that they are an inadequate response to links between consumer demand and the problem of forced labour in the sector as a whole .
Clamping down on demand for street prostitution does nothing to address – and may even strengthen – demand in other segments of the market , both legal and illegal , where forced / unfree labour can also be an issue ( pornography , escort agency prostitution , lap and table dance clubs , internet web ##AT##-##AT## cam sex , and so on ) .
Of course , it would be possible to extend the logic of the &quot; penalise the buyer &quot; approach to all forms of sex commerce : a total ban on all forms of sexualised entertainment and pornography involving actors / models ; raids on private homes and monitoring of private bank accounts to ensure that people are not using the internet to access sex workers ; phone taps to ensure that telephone sex is not being consumed .
But most would balk at the civil liberties implications of such an approach .
Given the political and moral problems posed by a policy of legal suppression , those who wish to see the commercial sex market shrink rather than continue to expand perhaps need to come up with more creative , less punitive and longer term strategies .
Third parties who employ sex workers in brothels , nightclubs , escort agencies , lap dance clubs and pimps who organise and financially benefit from another person &apos;s prostitution do not make decisions about employment practices , labour control and work organisation in a vacuum . Like all employers , they decide on strategies that are feasible and profitable in the particular social , legal and institutional context in which they operate .
The presence or absence of clear national employment conditions standards in settings such as lap ##AT##-##AT## dance establishments and , where legal , brothels , as well as of regular and effective monitoring and inspection in legal and &quot; irregular &quot; workplaces , clearly impacts on such decisions .
It is also important to recognise that whilst pimps and other third parties in the sex trade are often viewed as vile and immoral &quot; flesh peddlers &quot; , those who recruit labour for , and / or employ workers in the sex trade are not a socially , morally or politically homogeneous category of persons , and do not all adopt the same approach to their economic activity . A few may be crazed sociopaths , and at the other extreme , a few are committed to extremely ethical business practices .
Between are many ordinary people who , as human and social beings , need to tell themselves that their practices are normal , natural , necessary and / or inevitable , and so justified .
Prevailing social norms thus play an important role in shaping people &apos;s behaviour as &quot; employers &quot; in both legal and illegal segments of the commercial sex market . Third parties &apos; understanding of these norms is largely acquired by watching what others do and what the state allows them to get away with .
Indeed , it is depressing to observe how malleable most people are in terms of their morality in any market and how quickly they can adjust themselves to practices that they would previously have considered exploitative , providing no one stops them and others appear to be doing the same thing .
And so far as &quot; trafficking &quot; is concerned , it is also important to recognise that racism , xenophobia and prejudice against minority ethnic groups makes it much easier for employers , whether in the sex industry or any other sector , to tell themselves that exploitative labour practices are justified .
The racially / ethnically &quot; Other &quot; worker does not count as fully human , and so can be used and abused in ways that same race / ethnicity workers cannot be .
Women and girls who belong to groups that are in general socially devalued , and socially , politically and economically marginalized are also devalued by both employers and clients , and thus socially constructed as the &quot; natural &quot; or &quot; ideal &quot; occupants of the lowliest positions in the sex industry .
As with consumer demand , no single or clear ##AT##-##AT## cut policy implications follow . To the extent that the lack of application and enforcement of labour standards in the sex industry helps to create an environment in which it is possible and profitable to use unfree labour , I agree with the case for bringing the sex sector above ground and regulating it like any other industry .
But I also think it important to recognise that , for a number of reasons , the gains from this would be quite limited .
There are features of the sex sector that make it very difficult and very expensive to regulate effectively ( small units of employment , low start up costs , rapid turnover of labour and business establishments , geographical fluidity etc . ) .
And whether we are talking about the sex sector or any other &quot; difficult to regulate &quot; sector , governments are rarely willing to invest the level of resources that would be required to ensure that workers are all adequately protected .
Furthermore , there are features of custom and practice in many countries that make effective regulation difficult to implement , such as the practice whereby third parties who benefit from organising and controlling prostitution do not acknowledge themselves as direct employers , but instead treat prostitutes as self ##AT##-##AT## employed entrepreneurs who supposedly buy various services and / or rent facilities from the third party .
This is an arrangement that often conceals the imposition of very poor working conditions and a highly exploitative employment relation .
But at the same time , we cannot assume that those who sell sex always oppose it and would prefer a more regular , direct employment relation – they would not .
Many of those who prostitute do so on an irregular basis , using sex work as a means to pay off debts or save up for specific items , and would not wish to be subject to the discipline of a more permanent , visible and direct employment relation .
Indeed , visibility – something that is so central and necessary to the enforcement of basic minimum labour standards and employment protections – poses other dilemmas with regard to prostitution . Again , as with domestic work in private households , employers in the sex sector are often interested in migrants because their precarious position resulting from &quot; insecure legal status in the host country &quot; makes them less demanding and more flexible concerning working hours .
&#91; 10 &#93; But for many migrants who trade sex , becoming visible in the sense of their employment situation being subject to closer state regulation is more likely to mean being deported than it is to mean securing rights and protections as workers .
( Equally , where nationals work in prostitution to supplement poverty level benefits , visibility would more likely mean being prosecuted for benefit fraud than protection .
Those who trade sex are not a homogeneous group , and they position themselves in many different , complex and variable ways in relation to &quot; prostitution &quot; . At present , much sex commerce takes place in an unregulated underground , or an &quot; economy of makeshifts &quot; that stands outside civil society as defined above .
This remains the case even where a well ##AT##-##AT## regulated formal sector is established , as the existence of a legal sector does not mean that illegal or informal market segments automatically or necessarily disappear . The fact that prostitution is incompletely commodified is certainly one of the reasons why those who prostitute are still stigmatised and vulnerable to certain forms of abuse and exploitation , and there are some people who regard prostitution as a career and who would welcome the complete commodification of the commercial sex market .
But its incomplete commodification is also a reason why those who are already excluded from civil society ( eg , the very poor , runaway teenagers , drug addicts , undocumented migrants ) can turn to it as a means of survival . If prostitution were professionalised and incorporated into the &quot; moral economy &quot; as a legitimate and &quot; respectable &quot; form of work along the lines envisaged by some sex workers &apos; rights activists , it would not be open to these groups .
Moreover , many of those who turn to prostitution because they are dislocated , propertyless , and rightless do not approach prostitution as an occupation or a job as such , but merely as a strategy to get by . It is by no means clear that they would wish to be incorporated into civil society as a &quot; sex worker &quot; , even if this option was open to them .
Finally , regulation of the commercial sex industry does nothing , in itself , to counteract racism , xenophobia and prejudice against migrants and minority ethnic groups .
Indeed , the desire to apply and enforce labour standards in the sex industry can co ##AT##-##AT## exist with the wish to drive migrant women out of the sector .
Unless governments do something to address the social devaluation of migrants , and their social , political and economic marginalisation , regulation may merely serve to reinforce existing racial , ethnic , and national hierarchies in the sex industry .
&quot; Trafficking &quot; is often described as modern ##AT##-##AT## day slave trade , and for most people , this invokes images of women and children snatched from their homelands and forcibly transported to another land .
&#91; 13 &#93; The vast majority of eastern European , African , Latin American and Southeast Asian women and girls who end up in forced labour in prostitution in Western European countries wanted to migrate ( though not always to work in prostitution , and obviously never to be subject to forced labour in prostitution ) .
Furthermore , they invariably had good reason to want to migrate , which is why publicity about , and even personal experience of , the dangers associated with undocumented migration is rarely enough to stop people from taking the risk ( and also why some commentators refer to the repatriation of &quot; smuggled persons &quot; and &quot; victims of trafficking &quot; as &quot; reverse trafficking &quot; , i.e. , being moved against one &apos;s will across a border ) .
Similarly , interviews with 60 Moldovan adolescents who had been returned to Moldova found that almost all , including those who had been involved in prostitution abroad , wished to leave again ( indeed , some had been &quot; trafficked &quot; more than twice before ) .
&#91; 15 &#93; This should not surprise us , given that more than 50 per cent of the Moldovan population lives beneath a poverty threshold set at US $ 11.50 per month and that 30 per cent of Moldova &apos;s population is aged under 18 , and of them around 17 000 live ( or rather are held ) in grim and inadequately funded institutions for &quot; social orphans &quot; ( i.e. , children whose families are simply unable to support them ) .
In Moldova , for children and adults alike , labour migration is viewed as the only viable way to improve one &apos;s life ##AT##-##AT## chances , and remittances from migrants amount to 50 percent of Moldova &apos;s state budget .
Given that the conditions many migrants are seeking to escape are so bleak , violent and degrading , it is also hard to see why anyone genuinely concerned with protecting and promoting human rights would place measures to tackle consumer demand for commercial sex at the top of their policy agenda .
Measures to address poverty , global disparities of income , unemployment , gender inequalities , ethnic / racial conflict , political instability , etc .

Anyone who read the initial reports that the Czech writer Milan Kundera is alleged to have denounced the western agent Miroslav Dvorácek in 1950 could predict two things with certainty . First , that the events would be analyzed in the media according to the pattern of Stasi disclosure .
Second , that commentators would in some form or another make use of the title of Kundera &apos;s book , The Unbearable Lightness of Being .
Apparently , the twenty ##AT##-##AT## one year old student Milan Kundera appeared at a normal Prague police station to report that the twenty year ##AT##-##AT## old pilot Miroslav Dvorácek , who had escaped to West Germany and returned illegally to Prague , had left his suitcase in this or that student hall of residence , and would return to pick it up later that day .
Also aware of Dvorácek &apos;s visit apart from Kundera were Dvorácek &apos;s ex ##AT##-##AT## girlfriend Iva Militká and her new boyfriend Miroslav Dlask , both fellow students of Kundera at the Charles University .
Although the statement taken down at the police station is blemished by the failure to bear Kundera &apos;s signature and only his personal details , it is possible that such a document did indeed come to exist under the circumstances described . At any rate , Dvorácek , who was already on the wanted list , was arrested at the hall of residence that evening and put on trial .
Initially sentenced to death , he was later &quot; let off &quot; with a twenty ##AT##-##AT## two year prison sentence , fourteen of which he spent in one of Czechoslovakia &apos;s notorious uranium mines . Until the end , he was convinced that it was Militká who had betrayed him .
For years , she reproached herself for having talked to her boyfriend and later husband Dlask about her guest and thus involuntarily leading him into the hands of the authorities .
Dlask , on the other hand , may have looked upon the visitor as a competitor for Militka &apos;s affections , and moreover as someone who could have caused trouble for both of them .
Dlask then supposedly asked Kundera for help .
Today , Dvorácek lives in Stockholm and does not wish to comment directly about the affair .
Kundera , for his part , claims not to have known about the incident and views the publication of the Prague Institute as an &quot; assassination attempt &quot; .
Hence , we learn something about the &quot; what &quot; but not enough about the &quot; how &quot; and &quot; why &quot; in this tragic story .
In Czechoslovakia , the year 1950 stood very much in the shadow of the Great Terror , which was just beginning to gather momentum .
Fear of the system was gradually infiltrating the original atmosphere of socialist enthusiasm that had already been widespread in the pre ##AT##-##AT## war democracy . It began to take root in the minds and souls of the founding generation , who began to form a paranoid relationship to their own party .
The majority of the communist defendants in the show trials of the period , from the Slovak communist Vladimir &quot; Vlado &quot; Clementis to his colleague Rudolf Slansky , were charged with spying and treason and executed . Almost all were caught up in the cogs of the machinery that they themselves had helped to construct .
Twenty year ##AT##-##AT## olds at that time knew practically nothing about this situation and did not even have to be fanatic to denounce someone they thought they recognized as a class enemy .
If a person appeared in their circle who openly admitted having come from &quot; over there &quot; , in other words from behind the Iron Curtain , then in their eyes a failure to act was equal to complicity .
Moreover , they could assume that the mysterious acquaintance who had so suddenly surfaced was an agent provocateur for the secret police .
The absurdity of the situation became clear to them only years later . In probably his best novel , The Joke , Kundera himself wrote about the fate of an innocent culprit .
It is a story precisely about betrayal , love and ruined relationships – the central motifs of his later work .
Yet as concerns Miroslav , arrested back then in the student halls of residence , there is no reason retrospectively to turn him into a hero .
Spying against an unfree country is not automatically a freedom struggle , in the same way that the &quot; reconnaissance &quot; of an eastern European agent in the West was no peace mission .
Having said that , the young pilot may well have had noble motives , and to gather intelligence about conditions in his home country for the American Secret Services , during that spring of all times , required a courage that deserves a degree of admiration .
Nevertheless , there is the worry that , in his anti ##AT##-##AT## communist zeal , he was acting just as ignorantly as his contemporaries from the opposite side , and that his idealism was being exploited by his employers in a similar fashion .
At that time , to entrust such an obviously naive and ill ##AT##-##AT## prepared young man with such a task almost certainly meant placing him in a life ##AT##-##AT## threatening situation .
The draconian punishments and the barbarian conditions in the penal establishments must of course be blamed on the communist system , which in the twentieth century sacrificed hundreds of thousands – including many innocents – on the alter of its ideological insanity .
On one hand , the Kundera case can hardly be compared to the spying activities of other writers and artists .
Nevertheless , the manner of its publication creates some degree of likeness with the intellectual culprit ##AT##-##AT## victims exposed after 1990 as having worked for the various state security agencies : the StB , &#91; 1 &#93; the MfS , &#91; 2 &#93; Securitate , &#91; 3 &#93; Department III . / III . , &#91; 4 &#93; or the Derschawna Sigurnost .
&#91; 5 &#93; From this list it would not be hard to compile a crème de la crème of the eastern European intelligentsia ; at the same time , it is extremely important to distinguish between the cases and to check each on an individual basis .
What we are dealing with , namely , is a generation nearing the end of its life , which after the difficult formative years of the communist dictatorship attempted to free itself from the curse of its own past .
What is particularly sad about the careers of these protagonists is the fact that time and again they wanted to atone for their human and moral failure without being able to admit it .
Clearly , it was easier for them to act honestly then to speak openly .
Some things about the incident require further explanation . Only the court records and the investigation files can confirm how far the carelessly issued police statement actually played a role in the proceedings , or whether , for example , the three young people were summoned to appear before the court and if so , what their statements were .
It would also be of interest to find out the names of the officials who made the interrogation , the lawyers and the judge – questions that the authors of the revelations conspicuously fail to raise .
It could also prove to be the case that even with serious research , the relevant documents either fail to turn up or take a long time to find .
Until then , we should trust someone who during difficult times followed the principle of &quot; living in the truth &quot; , an attitude for which he made heavy sacrifices . Václav Havel warned the young historians to exercise caution when passing judgement on the youthful sins of a communist generation to which he himself never belonged .
Havel sees the author of The Joke suddenly forced into the Kunderaesque world of his own novels .
At the same time , he encourages his fellow writer , to whom he is bound more by argument than by friendship , with the moving words : &quot; Milan , rise above it ! There are worse things in life than being defamed by the press !

BK &apos;s Stereo ##AT##-##AT## Yashica - coupled 35mm cameras starting at 79 Euro , plus shipping .
Write to camera at exanova.com for additional Information .
I mostly feed Fuji &apos;s Sensia 100 and the results are outstanding ! In 1997 I made a pair of Nikon AF600 / Lite Touch , very compact combo , mounted vertically and stereo range from 50 centimeters to 5 meters , GREAT !
Then I have a pair of Pentax Super Program for better image quality and I &apos;m currently experimenting with two Canon EOS 1 and Voigtlander 15mm . The best stereophotos come with wide angles 24mm .. 32mm , and I also get stunning effects with 200 .. 300mm telephoto lenses on occasions .
My innovation consists of the combination of two identical point &amp; shoot 35mm cameras . Cameras have been combined before but often these were heavy and slow manual SLRs .
Modern consumer point &amp; shoot cameras produce better pictures than the Stereo Realists of the 50 &apos;s . But not any camera would do - although even disposable cameras would ( !
Not only have we got two ears but also two eyes . Stereo Photography is far older than the stereo audio we now take for granted in our everyday life .
That &apos;s because listening in stereo is easier than viewing stereo photos . In the 1950 &apos;s brands like Realist , TDC , Kodak , and many more created a craze that persists into the third millenium .
A few of the old folks are still around , but stereo cameras did not enjoy many of the advances in imaging technology over the late 20th century .
Either you make your own stereocamera or you work with cameras from the 50 &apos;s .
The two cameras autofocus system may be a problem to sync , some cameras use spot metering while others employ multi ##AT##-##AT## beam systems and there could be situations when one of the two cameras is out of sync .
The better AF camera models have an override function to focus on infinity .
Another sync problem can be exposure and use of flash , where one camera decides to fire and the other one does not .
But these cases are rare - when these cameras are well matched there is only 1 out of 40 photos affected by desychronization .
The question of shutter ##AT##-##AT## synchronizing two cameras is solved by attaching a common electrical switch to the two shutter release buttons . Easier said than done : Most point &amp; shoot do not allow for remote activation .

Author Hans Kwint has written an interesting article on his usage of Gentoo Linux on the desktop .
Entitled A Gentoo diary : Intro &quot; , it is the first in a series of articles on Gentoo usage in daily life .
The Linux Link Tech Show has a pretty long interview with four Gentoo developers , Mike Frysinger , Michael Cummings , Grant Goodyear , and Seemant Kulleen .
It can be downloaded in either OGG Vorbis or MP3 format .
The interview starts at about 24 1 / 2 minutes .
AnandTech recently did a shoot ##AT##-##AT## out of several different processors , including the Sun UltraSparc T1 .
For the article , they chose Gentoo Linux as the platform for the machines .
Check out the article to see how the new Sun CPU fares against Intel &apos;s Wood crest and AMD &apos;s Opteron .
While most of today &apos;s games won &apos;t run on Linux systems easily , there is still a wealth of options in yesterday &apos;s catalog that work great with an emulator .
If you can hunt down an original copy of the games , ScummVM will run some classic point ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## click adventure games such as &quot; Full Throttle &quot; , &quot; Day of the Tentacle &quot; and &quot; The Secret of Monkey Island .
The project first started out as a way to run old games that used LucasArt &apos;s SCUMM game engine , but now supports other games as well .
See the compatibility list for all the games it can run .
If you &apos;re not up to the task of hunting down computer games from the 1980s though , you &apos;re still in luck .
One such game has been released for free distribution -- Flight of the Amazon Queen , and it &apos;s available in portage .
To get up and running , first emerge scummvm on your system , which is already been marked stable on four architectures -- amd64 , ppc , sparc , and x86 .
ScummVM itself runs on many other platforms : Microsoft Windows , Mac OS X , PocketPC , PalmOS , OS / 2 and more .
Depending on your architecture , Flight of the Amazon Queen might be marked testing , so adjust your package.keywords file as necessary .
After that , add your user to the &apos; games &apos; group if you haven &apos;t already .
If you are adding your user to the group , remember that you must log out and back in before the changes will take effect .
Fire up scummvm , and it will open a graphical window where you can add your games .
By default , FOTAQ won &apos;t be displayed in the list , but you can add it by clicking &apos; Add Game &apos; .
The directory with game data is / usr / share / games / queen .
Once you navigate to that directory , simply click the &apos; Choose &apos; button .
You can also simply run &apos; queen &apos; to start the game directly .

Summary : This is the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter for the week of 26 June 2006 .
( Own report ) - German foreign policy makers , are upping their political pressure on Beijing , and holding talks with a Chinese separatist . As the Munich based &quot; World Uyghur Congress ( WUC ) &quot; announced , its president , Rebiya Kadeer will also be received by the foreign ministry .
The Uyghurs , a Muslim minority from the autonomous region Xinjiang ( Western China ) , are seeking the secession of their region &quot; East Turkestan &quot; from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
Rebiya Kadeer &apos;s appearance in the German capital has been carefully stage managed for high profile in conjunction with US activities . Following the Dalai Lama &apos;s German Chancellery visit , Berlin has been escalating its anti ##AT##-##AT## Beijing secessionist offensive .
Rebiya Kadeer is visiting Berlin shortly after the Dalai Lama ended his European tour that provoked strong protest from Beijing . In September , the head of the self proclaimed Tibetan exile government visited the Spanish province Catalonia that , after having gained extensive autonomy rights , is seeking secession .
The Munich based exile movement seeks to merge the Uyghur secessionist movement with the Tibetan and the Mongolian movements , to break up the Chinese nation from several of its peripheral regions .
In 1985 , former CIA advisor Alptekin participated in the foundation of the &quot; Allied Committee of the Peoples of East Turkestan , Tibet and Inner Mongolia &quot; . He supported in 1998 , an international conference in New York , organized by this Committee , where representatives of the US government were in attendance .
The strategy of ethnic movements is shared by the Dalai Lama . In his message of greetings to the conference in New York , he wrote : &quot; Geography , history and currently Chinese occupation is connecting our three peoples .

Sol y Nieve means great snow for skiing in Sierra Nevada Spain .
Sol y Nieve in Pradollano is the name of this amazing ski resort in the Sierra Nevada .
The sun is shining at 70 % of the days in one year !
Sol y nieve is situated in a hight of 2.100m til 3.300m above sea level . Therefore the snow quality is good even in the late spring time .
The andalusian sun has an important influence on the snow conditions as they will change during the day . The best time to enjoy fast but grippy slopes is between 9am and 13pm when the sun is slowly melting the frozen snow top layer .
Even if nature wouldn &apos;t support your snow holidays ( by keeping away the clouds to bring the fresh snow ) there are 428 snow canons to provide 31,8km of slopes with artificial snow .
Valderrama is ranked among the top 100 courses in the world , one of the top 10 in Europe and 1st in Spain .
Lush tree lined fairways and immaculate elevated greens give this course the recognition it so deserves .
The best players in the world have played it , and it has also been host to the Ryder Cup and the Volvo Masters .
Valderrama is a 6356 metres par 71 with no hole of less than championship quality but it can be fully enjoyed by players of all handicaps , thanks to the genius of Robert Trent Jones , Senior , whom many consider the leading golf architect of his day .
Each hole has a Professional tee ( 6356m ) , a Club Championship tee ( 5994m ) , an Executive tee ( 5498m ) and a Seniors &apos; tee ( 5053m ) , as well as a ladies Professional tee ( 5294m ) and a ladies Club tee ( 4873m ) . The tees are differentiated not just by distance but by careful siting .

SEO is an acronym for &quot; search engine optimization &quot; or &quot; search engine optimizer .
&quot; Deciding to hire an SEO is a big decision that can potentially improve your site and save time , but you can also risk damage to your site and reputation .
Make sure to research the potential advantages as well as the damage that an irresponsible SEO can do to your site .
Expertise in specific markets and geographies .
Keep in mind that the Google search results page includes organic search results and often paid advertisement ( denoted by the heading &quot; Sponsored Links &quot; ) as well .
Advertising with Google won &apos;t have any effect on your site &apos;s presence in our search results .
Google never accepts money to include or rank sites in our search results , and it costs nothing to appear in our organic search results .
Free resources such as Webmaster Tools , the official Webmaster Central blog , and our discussion forum can provide you with a great deal of information about how to optimize your site for organic search .
Many of these free sources , as well as information on paid search , can be found on Google Webmaster Central .
Before beginning your search for an SEO , it &apos;s a great idea to become an educated consumer and get familiar with how search engines work .
Google 101 : How Google crawls , indexes and serves the web .
If you &apos;re thinking about hiring an SEO , the earlier the better .
A great time to hire is when you &apos;re considering a site redesign , or planning to launch a new site .
That way , you and your SEO can ensure that your site is designed to be search engine ##AT##-##AT## friendly from the bottom up .
However , a good SEO can also help improve an existing site .
Can you show me examples of your previous work and share some success stories ?
Do you follow the Google Webmaster Guidelines ?
Do you offer any online marketing services or advice to complement your organic search business ?
What kind of results do you expect to see , and in what timeframe ?
How long have you been in business ?
How can I expect to communicate with you ?
Will you share with me all the changes you make to my site , and provide detailed information about your recommendations and the reasoning behind them ?
While SEOs can provide clients with valuable services , some unethical SEOs have given the industry a black eye through their overly aggressive marketing efforts and their attempts to manipulate search engine results in unfair ways .
Practices that violate our guidelines may result in a negative adjustment of your site &apos;s presence in Google , or even the removal of your site from our index .
Be wary of SEO firms and web consultants or agencies that send you email out of the blue .
Reserve the same skepticism for unsolicited email about search engines as you do for &quot; burn fat at night &quot; diet pills or requests to help transfer funds from deposed dictators .
No one can guarantee a # 1 ranking on Google .
Beware of SEOs that claim to guarantee rankings , allege a &quot; special relationship &quot; with Google , or advertise a &quot; priority submit &quot; to Google .
There is no priority submit for Google .
In fact , the only way to submit a site to Google directly is through our Add URL page or by submitting a Sitemap and you can do this yourself at no cost whatsoever .
Be careful if a company is secretive or won &apos;t clearly explain what they intend to do .
Ask for explanations if something is unclear .
If an SEO creates deceptive or misleading content on your behalf , such as doorway pages or &quot; throwaway &quot; domains , your site could be removed entirely from Google &apos;s index .
Ultimately , you are responsible for the actions of any companies you hire , so it &apos;s best to be sure you know exactly how they intend to &quot; help &quot; you .
You should never have to link to an SEO .
Avoid SEOs that talk about the power of &quot; free ##AT##-##AT## for ##AT##-##AT## all &quot; links , link popularity schemes , or submitting your site to thousands of search engines .
These are typically useless exercises that don &apos;t affect your ranking in the results of the major search engines -- at least , not in a way you would likely consider to be positive .
While you consider whether to go with an SEO , you may want to do some research on the industry .
Google is one way to do that , of course .
You might also seek out a few of the cautionary tales that have appeared in the press , including this article on one particularly aggressive SEO : http : / / seattletimes.nwsource.com / html / businesstechnology / 2002002970 ##UNDERSCORE## nwbizbriefs12.html .
While Google doesn &apos;t comment on specific companies , we &apos;ve encountered firms calling themselves SEOs who follow practices that are clearly beyond the pale of accepted business behavior .
Be sure to understand where the money goes .
While Google never sells better ranking in our search results , several other search engines combine pay ##AT##-##AT## per ##AT##-##AT## click or pay ##AT##-##AT## for ##AT##-##AT## inclusion results with their regular web search results .
Some SEOs will promise to rank you highly in search engines , but place you in the advertising section rather than in the search results .
A few SEOs will even change their bid prices in real time to create the illusion that they &quot; control &quot; other search engines and can place themselves in the slot of their choice .
This scam doesn &apos;t work with Google because our advertising is clearly labeled and separated from our search results , but be sure to ask any SEO you &apos;re considering which fees go toward permanent inclusion and which apply toward temporary advertising .
What are the most common abuses a website owner is likely to encounter ?
One common scam is the creation of &quot; shadow &quot; domains that funnel users to a site by using deceptive redirects .
These shadow domains often will be owned by the SEO who claims to be working on a client &apos;s behalf .
However , if the relationship sours , the SEO may point the domain to a different site , or even to a competitor &apos;s domain .
If that happens , the client has paid to develop a competing site owned entirely by the SEO .
Another illicit practice is to place &quot; doorway &quot; pages loaded with keywords on the client &apos;s site somewhere .
The SEO promises this will make the page more relevant for more queries .
This is inherently false since individual pages are rarely relevant for a wide range of keywords .
More insidious , however , is that these doorway pages often contain hidden links to the SEO &apos;s other clients as well .
Such doorway pages drain away the link popularity of a site and route it to the SEO and its other clients , which may include sites with unsavory or illegal content .
What are some other things to look out for ?
There are a few warning signs that you may be dealing with a rogue SEO .
It &apos;s far from a comprehensive list , so if you have any doubts , you should trust your instincts .
If you feel that you were deceived by an SEO in some way , you may want to report it .
In the United States , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) handles complaints about deceptive or unfair business practices .
If your complaint is against a company in a country other than the United States , please file it at http : / / www.econsumer.gov / .

Dangriga Town , formerly known as Stann Creek Town , is a town in southern Belize , located on the Caribbean coast at the mouth of Stann Creek .
It is the capital of Belize &apos;s Stann Creek District and also forms its own constituency .
Dangriga was settled in or slightly before 1832 by Garifuna ( Black Caribs , as they were known to the British ) from Honduras .
It was for a long time the second largest population centre in the country behind Belize City , but in recent years has been surpassed by Orange Walk Town . The population is mostly a mixture of Garinagu , Kriols and Mestizos .
Dangriga takes it name from the local Garifuna language , loosely meaning &quot; here , the sweet water is close at hand .
&quot; It lies peacefully along the banks of the North Stann Creek River , whose water is legendary . The town &apos;s drinking supply is refreshingly cool and arguably the best tasting in Belize .

Learn the theory behind XRF spectrometry with this short interactive flash movie .
Although more popularly known for its diagnostic use in the medical field , the use of x ##AT##-##AT## rays forms the basis of many other powerful measurement techniques , including X ##AT##-##AT## ray Fluorescence ( XRF ) Spectrometry .
XRF Spectrometry is used to identify elements in a substance and quantify the amount of those elements present to ultimately determine the elemental composition of a material .
An element is identified by its characteristic X ##AT##-##AT## ray emission wavelength ( λ ) or energy ( E ) .
The amount of an element present is quantified by measuring the intensity ( I ) of its characteristic emission .
All atoms have a fixed number of electrons ( negatively charged particles ) arranged in orbitals around the nucleus .
Energy Dispersive ( ED ) XRF and Wavelength Dispersive ( WD ) XRF Spectrometry typically utilize activity in the first three electron orbitals , the K , L , and M lines , where K is closest to the nucleus .
In XRF Spectrometry , high ##AT##-##AT## energy primary X ##AT##-##AT## ray photons are emitted from a source ( X ##AT##-##AT## ray tube ) and strike the sample .
The primary photons from the X ##AT##-##AT## ray tube have enough energy to knock electrons out of the innermost , K or L , orbitals .
When this occurs , the atoms become ions , which are unstable .
An electron from an outer orbital , L or M , will move into the newly vacant space at the inner orbital to regain stability .
As the electron from the outer orbital moves into the inner orbital space , it emits an energy known as a secondary X ##AT##-##AT## ray photon .
The secondary X ##AT##-##AT## ray produced is characteristic of a specific element .
The energy ( E ) of the emitted fluorescent X ##AT##-##AT## ray photon is determined by the difference in energies between the initial and final orbitals of the individual transitions .
where h is Planck &apos;s constant ; c is the velocity of light ; and λ is the characteristic wavelength of the photon .
Energies are inversely proportional to the wavelengths ; they are characteristic for each element .
For example the Kα energy for Iron ( Fe ) is about 6.4keV.
Typical spectra for EDXRF Spectrometry appear as a plot of Energy ( E ) versus the Intensity ( I ) .
XRF Spectrometry is the choice of many analysts for elemental analysis .
XRF Spectrometry easily and quickly identifies and quantifies elements over a wide dynamic concentration range , from PPM levels up to virtually 100 % by weight .
XRF Spectrometry does not destroy the sample and requires little , if any , sample preparation .
It has a very fast overall analysis turnaround time .
These factors lead to a significant reduction in the per sample analytical cost when compared to other elemental analysis techniques .
Aqueous elemental analysis instrument techniques typically require destructive and time ##AT##-##AT## consuming specimen preparation , often using concentrated acids or other hazardous materials .
Not only is the sample destroyed , waste streams are generated during the analysis process that need to be disposed of , many of which are hazardous .
These aqueous elemental analysis techniques often take twenty minutes to several hours for sample preparation and analysis time .
All of these factors lead to a relatively high cost per sample .
However , if PPB and lower elemental concentrations are the primary measurement need , aqueous instrument elemental analysis techniques are necessary .
All elemental analysis techniques experience interferences , both chemical and physical in nature , and must be corrected or compensated for in order to achieve adequate analytical results .
Most aqueous instrument techniques for elemental analysis suffer from interferences that are corrected for by extensive and complex sample preparation techniques , instrumentation modifications or enhancements , and by mathematical corrections in the system &apos;s software .
In XRF Spectrometry , the primary interference is from other specific elements in a substance that can influence ( matrix effects ) the analysis of the element ( s ) of interest .
However , these interferences are well known and documented ; and , instrumentation advancements and mathematical corrections in the system &apos;s software easily and quickly correct for them .
In certain cases , the geometry of the sample can affect XRF analysis , but this is easily compensated for by selecting the optimum sampling area , grinding or polishing the sample , or by pressing a pellet or making glass beads .
Quantitative elemental analysis for XRF Spectrometry is typically performed using Empirical Methods ( calibration curves using standards similar in property to the unknown ) or Fundamental Parameters ( FP ) .
FP is frequently preferred because it allows elemental analysis to be performed without standards or calibration curves .
This enables the analyst to use the system immediately , without having to spend additional time setting up individual calibration curves for the various elements and materials of interest .
The capabilities of modern computers allow the use of this no ##AT##-##AT## standard mathematical analysis , FP , accompanied by stored libraries of known materials , to determine not only the elemental composition of an unknown material quickly and easily , but even to identify the unknown material itself .
Innov ##AT##-##AT## X Systems utilizes the EDXRF Spectrometer technique for its mechanical simplicity and excellent adaptation to portable field use .
An EDXRF system typically has three major components : an excitation source , a spectrometer / detector , and a data collection / processing unit .
The ease of use , rapid analysis time , lower initial purchase price and substantially lower long ##AT##-##AT## term maintenance costs of EDXRF Spectrometers have led to having more systems in use today worldwide than WDXRF Spectrometer systems .
Handheld , field portable EDXRF units can be taken directly to the sample as opposed to bringing the sample to the analyzer and configuring it to fit in an analysis chamber .
Innov ##AT##-##AT## X Systems portable , handheld EDXRF units solve real 21 st century application problems : solving crimes , analyzing alloys , exposing pollution , preserving history , searching for WMD &apos;s , conserving art treasures , and a myriad of other elemental field ##AT##-##AT## oriented analyses .

&quot; Your music reflects the Austrian landscape : the vineyards , the golden leaves of autumn , the brilliant sky overhead , melancholy and kindness , vitality and life , a dream , romantically bewitching Austria . Your strength of character cannot be contained by the borders of this land ; you rejected all devils &apos; bargains , and made no concession to conquerors and rulers .
Your imagination is not a retreat from reality , and what rings the truest , is a courageous heart . It is also the wellspring of your mood , which is in opposition to Austrian sloppiness , namely attacks against all overblown , disrespectful dialog about authority .
And that , in this place , is to be praised above all else . Therefore , thank you , dear Sir , for your artistry and your courage .
It isn &apos;t widely known outside Austria that for decades in his homeland , Joseph Marx has been closely associated with the Nazi regime .
This belief led to &quot; denunciations &quot; as well as labels such as &quot; Marx , the Nazi boot ##AT##-##AT## licker &quot; or &quot; Nazi ##AT##-##AT## lover . &quot; Some even believe Marx was a card ##AT##-##AT## carrying Nazi .
The following observation is presented in the form of a comparison of questions and facts that will serve as clarification of not only this subject , but can also be partly transferred to other artists of that era , and should help the reader form an objective opinion . The information collected here is drawn from the biographies and writings listed in the &quot; Bibliography , &quot; and also relies heavily on dozens of interviews I conducted with persons who worked and interacted privately with Joseph Marx .
Was Marx a Nazi sympathizer or at least , a conformist ?
As an outspoken individualist and completely devoted to art and music , Marx never in his life joined a specific political movement . Based on his conservative views of tonality and composition , and his long ##AT##-##AT## established position as one of the leading music teachers in Austria it was in the Ministry of Propaganda &apos;s best interests to exploit Marx for specific political purposes ( as it happened with many other artists and cultural figures of the time ) .
This is most evident in that Marx presented lectures in which he especially praised the performance activity and the multi ##AT##-##AT## faceted nature of musical life in the Nazi state . It must be noted that in these lectures Marx avoided concrete political pronouncements and limited himself to the evaluation of efforts in the musical arena particularly in the areas of cultural and musical heritage and suggestions pertinent to that ; in other words , to themes over which he could exercise his own judgment .
In the interests of self ##AT##-##AT## preservation , Marx , a well ##AT##-##AT## respected figure throughout Austria long before the Nazi seizure of power , had to conduct himself diplomatically and trod a very dangerous balancing act .
The Ministry of Propaganda had the means and the power to place uncooperative artists in the worst possible situations , in which performances or exhibitions of their works would be banned .
Far ##AT##-##AT## reaching measures were in place , through which people could simply be removed from their jobs and their assets seized , and all too often notes and manuscripts would be confiscated ; compositions and literary works by many non ##AT##-##AT## Jewish artists were also burned or otherwise destroyed and lost forever .
It is all too often forgotten that at that time , Marx the composer , who for decades was the ambivalent central figure of tonal music in Austria , was under constant threat of displacement by proponents of the rapidly developing Avant ##AT##-##AT## garde . It can be deduced that he sought to use his lectures as a platform for the advancement of his own musical viewpoint , with which he went so far as to try to be a positive legislative influence on the cultural development of the populace .
In light of this situation , it is interesting that Marx , in the final days of the Nazi regime , turned down numerous invitations to speak with patently absurd excuses that were completely unacceptable to the Reich Propaganda Office , for example , &quot; I have to administer a test &quot; or better still , &quot; I don &apos;t have any money for carfare , &quot; to which the propaganda office , by the way , promised to send him a train ticket .
From my conversations with Marx &apos;s surviving friends the following impression is formed . Marx had to have been a charismatic and free ##AT##-##AT## spirited non ##AT##-##AT## conformist , who in meetings with Nazi functionaries &quot; spoke his mind &quot; with no regard for consequences and &quot; in now way allowed himself to be taken advantage of &quot; .
One of my interviewees told me a number of anecdotes that proved beyond all doubt that Marx was a master of irony and was not afraid to make Nazi functionaries &quot; look like fools &quot; .
It allows one thing to be said with certainty , namely that in the fifties , Marx began a slow retreat from public life and focused himself on his never ##AT##-##AT## conquered inner connection with nature and its mystical connection with art . Marx described this directly in the revealing ORF interviews from 1952 , saying that he had remained fundamentally connected with Nature during his entire life , and this connection had sustained his well ##AT##-##AT## known effusiveness .
At this point it should be briefly mentioned that even before his philosophical studies , Marx already had a metaphysical worldview .
In many private letters Marx , who placed a high demand on the cultural level of a nation and was universally recognized as a literary and artistically educated person , expressed his sorrow over the rampant decay of values between the two world wars and the accompanying waning of concern for ethics and spiritual matters .
It should also be noted here that in the majority of his letters Marx expressed the heartfelt wish to see his distant friends more often , so that finally , they could again have the deep discussions that he treasured so much .
Marx constantly strove to meet the high ideals of &quot; lofty art &quot; in the manner of the traditional masters he revered : Mozart , Haydn , Schubert , Beethoven , Brahms , etc .
His famous motto &quot; Not everything that has been composed should be called music &quot; is indicative of his viewpoint that music should play within the borders of tonality , although he did expand those borders somewhat , and not only in selected passages of his own work , but ironically also in the evaluation of modern works , as Marx also praised the works of those Modern composers who at least included tonal elements in their pieces ( it is interesting in this situation that he once sought to bring Schönberg to the Vienna Academy of Music ) .
His extreme criticism of the Avant ##AT##-##AT## garde manifested itself long before the birth of the anti ##AT##-##AT## Semitic Nazi regime .
On the other hand , Marx had many friends among atonal composers that went much deeper than a &quot; peaceful coexistence &quot; .
Many of his students who had already broken away from the tonal System during their educations , later reported that their relationship with their teacher Marx was always marked by mutual respect and understanding , and they were grateful for the comprehensive musical education that he provided .
Marx &apos;s students and other survivors told me that many Jews were also among his large circle of friends and acquaintances .
When questioned about it specifically , they maintained that Marx showed absolutely no tendency toward racism or anti ##AT##-##AT## Semitism , but that there was never a more open ##AT##-##AT## minded , dearer man , for whom a person &apos;s race or origins made no difference .
Erich Wolfgang Korngold , as we know , who throughout his lifetime was a friend of Marx &apos;s , happened to be Jewish - as was Franz Schreker , who likewise belonged to Marx &apos;s closest circle of colleagues and friends . In addition , the titles of Marx &apos;s compositions and his song texts contain not even the remotest hint of Nazi , or indeed anti ##AT##-##AT## Semitic sentiment .
Further , I have in my possession a collection of letters in which enduring friendships between Marx and numerous colleagues and friends who were persecuted and expelled for their Jewish beliefs are documented .
Yet another interesting example of Marx &apos;s versatile personality is found in a conversation with a family with whom Marx had been close friends for many years , and who told me that he used his position as district music director , as was his official title for a while , to help Jews .
New information , supported by countless letters and documented evidence readily found in the collections of the National Library casts him in a completely different light - that Marx constantly did all in his power to reestablish performances of the works of Jewish composers in Austria &apos;s concert halls .
This would have been a further reason for his occasional acquiescence to the plans of Nazi functionaries ; if he had openly rebelled against them , he could have certainly kissed his influential position in the music world goodbye , that had made it possible for him to assist those countless ( not a few from Jewish refugees ) inquiries .
Korngold is the best ##AT##-##AT## known example , but there are many letters from Jewish artists , who sought assistance from Marx even long after World War II . The sheer number of requests and thank ##AT##-##AT## you letters shows that Marx had to have been not only the court of last resort , but the first for his Jewish colleagues and students .
One can only guess at the difficult and likely critical situations in which Marx had to maneuver himself , as he showed the countless artists who had flown Austria or had been driven out by the Nazis ways to regain a foothold in their homeland .
A definitive impression begins to form of Joseph Marx &apos;s character , for as has already been mentioned in his biography , Marx gave extra lessons to many of his students who needed them , indeed often holding private , free sessions during his free time .
Based on his enormous willingness to help and the high esteem in which he was held , it is all the more astounding , indeed almost unbelievable that he has been labeled a Nazi sympathizer for so long .
Not a few of his Jewish students and friends traveled from America back to Austria after the war solely to visit their highly ##AT##-##AT## regarded teacher and friend Joseph Marx , as was the case with Herbert Zipper . That Marx was revered by the great majority of his students and was honored up until his death with countless letters and visits from all parts of the world is already known , but from whence his enormous esteem for his Jewish students comes , is uncertain .
In the meantime , a newly disclosed packet of letters has brought to light that Marx assisted numerous Jewish families who enlisted his aid by securing homes and positions in foreign lands , which means that he has rescued them from deportation .
In addition Marx , as evidenced by his letters , constantly did all in his power to see to it that combat soldiers whom he knew personally ( for example , his students ) , and their units would be entertained , among other things by the organization of musical events that the troops attended , and in which they often participated .
Marx &apos;s house maid who experienced him in the years 1938 ##AT##-##AT## 43 ( Austria was taken over by the Nazi regime in March 1938 ) , reported to me that Marx never supported those Austrians who followed the Germanizing of Austria by the Nazi propaganda machinery . The &quot; Hitler salute &quot; was not tolerated in Marx &apos;s house .
As a reminder : We are discussing the same person who is still branded a Nazi collaborator in many poorly informed circles of the Austrian music world !
Could one from this , at least , deduce a tendency towards a national socialistic viewpoint ? This point is mentioned , only because Marx was first and foremost an artist and creative person , who owed much of his inspiration to Austrian culture and , indeed , the entire realm of German ##AT##-##AT## speaking poets , composers and thinkers .
It is a generally recognized and acknowledged fact today , that because of the politically charged atmosphere of that decade , not only Marx , but many other important artists , musicians and literary figures of his time were persuaded to mouth the party line , without being accused of having an overly zealous association with the Nazis .
If this is a legitimate question , would it not be analogous , for example , to reach the grotesque conclusion that also the etymologists and assorted clubs who for years have sought to preserve the purity of the German language , should also be accused of having a strong nationalistic , perhaps even Nazi Attitude ?
Jewish composer Herbert Zipper ( survivor of the Nazi concentration camp in Dachau ) who wrote the famous &quot; Dachau ##AT##-##AT## Lied &quot; , travelled from the USA to Austria in 1956 only with the intention of seeing again his &quot; revered teacher and friend &quot; Joseph Marx . Remember : This is the same Joseph Marx who in Austria has been publicly accused of having been a powerful Nazi .
So what really happened in Austria between the two world wars and after World War 2 , and what has this got to with the neglect of Marx &apos;s music during the last couple of decades ?
The main problem has two sides : Musicology and cultural policy .
Musicology : In the years 1905 ##AT##-##AT## 09 , Marx has made huge experiments by working with thousands of subjects of different ages and different levels of education . These experiments showed him that tonality most probably is a universal law deeply connected with human perception and psychology .
Marx &apos;s experiments that were unprecedented until that time and that widely developped Riemann &apos;s theories of the 19th century , were worked out with Alexius von Meinong and Vittorio Benussi who were among Austria &apos;s leading experimental psychologists of that era . After evaluating all the results in 1909 , Marx literally HAD TO believe that all atonal , polytonal and other possible ways of &quot; intellectual construction &quot; of tone structures must be &quot; against a universal principle &quot; .
Nevertheless , it was certainly unfair of him that he sometimes abused his authority to put obstacles in the way of young Avantgarde musicians , but one should be aware that Marx was just one of the leading figures of a whole Austrian generation who did that . And so we have to talk about the second side of the problem : Cultural politics .
The Austrian music between 1922 ( when Marx became powerful and at the same time the twelfe ##AT##-##AT## tone music was founded ) and approximately 1960 , was divided into two groups , the tonalists and the members of the Second Viennese School of Arnold Schoenberg ( including their following younger generation ) . The atonalists ( many of which , ironically , were formerly taught by Joseph Marx !
They also had important representants in functionary roles of Austria &apos;s cultural and musical life . There was an open battle between the two groups .
He occasionally abused his authority in order to suppress the Avantgarde in the open battle between tonal and atonal Austrian musicians .
Amazingly , the archive doesn &apos;t mention a single negative word about Marx . Nevertheless , parts of the Austrian music scene still believe that Marx was a powerful Nazi sympathizer , and this mistake was intentionally created by an Avantgarde generation after Marx &apos;s death who then suppressed performances of his music and spread around Nazi accusations against him although everything untrue ( as you can read in the other parts of this article ) and although he , already dead , was unable to defend himself .
Because Austria has a HUGE problem with its own Nazi history of the period after 1938 ( when Austria was taken over by Nazi Germany ) . Almost every Austrian has or had relatives who became an active Nazi after Austria had been &quot; swallowed &quot; by the Nazi regime in March 1938 .
So this topic still is a kind of taboo in Austria , and it &apos;s totally different from Germany where the last two generations have accepted and exposed all of the guilts of their fathers and grandfathers by making hundreds of TV documentations , exhibitions and other stuff .
This is why many open ##AT##-##AT## minded Austrians wrote to me that they are so grateful that someone supports this process of &quot; freeing the mind &quot; and exposes the truth about Joseph Marx after such a long time of lies and unconfirmed rumors .
It would still be impossible to do that in Austria . &quot; ( One must know that I live in Germany ) .
The preceding evidence shows that the accusations against Joseph Marx are based largely on a distortion , or at least ignorance of , many factors . One gains the impression that those who laid the foundation for these accusations did not take into account the entire course of events , but rather had to have pulled events out of context .
This may have been done with the intent to sow a specific opinion about Marx that the true circumstances of his time can hardly reflect , and cannot in any way do a complex personality like Marx justice . But one must also guard against judging those instigators of these widely held , rash beliefs in a similar , biased manner : After all , prior to the establishment of this Internet site , there existed no comprehensive , published body of research in which all of the above facts were assembled and available in their entirety .
It is for exactly this reason that I have written this essay : to enlighten and recall that the quest for truth is always the best way to illuminate and observe things from all sides , to remain ready to challenge long ##AT##-##AT## held beliefs , even to completely reconsider them . At any rate , one occasionally has to throw some old ways of thinking overboard and thus remain open to abandon accepted truths , rather than to choose to believe only what makes us comfortable .
And , ironically , many find this unbearably difficult . But to summarize objectively : Who would want to be trade places with someone who , already long before the rise of National Socialism , had led a public life , and was automatically under pressure after the takeover of the Nazi regime ?
Is it possible to render an objective verdict on people like Joseph Marx for the difficult decisions such as what they had to make in that time , the weight of which we today can &apos;t comprehend , in some way judge them ?
Now is the time for Joseph Marx to receive the well ##AT##-##AT## deserved praise that Austrian music of the 20th century , as well as uncounted musicians the world over , owe him .
With heartfelt thanks to Mrs. Rosemary Hilmar from the Austrian National Library ( Manuscript Collection ) for her untiring work in the development of the collections of musicians &apos; correspondence administered by the National Library , Vienna .

Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 digital SLR camera review : Olympus is making waves with the digital SLR cameras .
The models are quickly being improved and renewed .
We still await the successor of the E ##AT##-##AT## 1 ( Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 3 ) , but the Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 D ##AT##-##AT## SLR gives us a taste of what is to come .
The Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 is the successor of the E ##AT##-##AT## 500 , which was released more than a year and a half ago .
The changes made to the E ##AT##-##AT## 400 in the E ##AT##-##AT## 410 were minimal , but the Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 digital SLR is truly different from its predecessor .
Olympus uses a Panasonic sensor for the E ##AT##-##AT## 510 instead of a Kodak sensor .
As the name suggests , the Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 also has Live View , just like other Olympus models have .
Live View is now definitively the future of the DSLR .
Not only Olympus and Panasonic are applying this , but also Canon and Nikon have included Live View in their new DSLR products .
At first Olympus and Panasonic were looked upon with pity when they first showed the Live View , but quickly it appeared to be a consumer advantage .
Next to the new sensor the amount of pixels has increased .
The Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 now has ten Megapixels , the same amount as the E ##AT##-##AT## 410 .
This amount of resolution allows for large prints .
The signal is processed differently than in the E ##AT##-##AT## 410 , though , so that we can expect different results .
Thanks to the SuperSonic Wave Filter placed in front of the sensor , you do not longer have to worry about having to retouch a lot of dust spots .
This is great , because with ten Megapixels you can see almost every detail .
The filter in front of the sensor shakes and the sensor itself can move as well .
This has allowed Olympus to integrate a physical image stabilizer .
You do not need special lenses in order to prevent blur from camera shake .
The dimensions have hardly changed at all .
The camera is a bit wider and a bit thinner and longer as well .
The camera still has a lot in common with the legendary Olympus OM series .
The compact body is partly possible because of the FourThirds System , of which Olympus is one of the pioneers .
The sensor format is half the size of a 35 mm film .
The focal range has a factor of 2 , so that a 14 ##AT##-##AT## 45 mm lens behaves as a 28 ##AT##-##AT## 90 mm lens would ( on a 35 mm camera ) .
The whole system is easy to carry with you .
The FourThirds System keeps expanding , not only with new cameras , but with new lenses , including a few real top models .
While we tested the Olympus Evolt E ##AT##-##AT## 510 , we also had a few lenses at our disposal , including the Zuiko Digital 7 ##AT##-##AT## 14mm 1 : 4 ED .
It is an ultra wide ##AT##-##AT## angle lens , but not quite a fisheye .
On a 35 mm camera it would be equivalent to a 14 ##AT##-##AT## 28 mm lens .
This is a very interesting range for photojournalists and landscape photographers .
We have tested an Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 and a few lenses for a while in our test lab .
The results can be read in the next Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 review .
Nikon D60 digital SLR camera review : Nikon changed direction with the introduction of the D40 in 2006 and the D40x in 2007 .
The digital SLR camera was allowed to become compact and one should be able to carry it around just as easily as a compact camera .
Of course there are limits from a technical point of view as to how compact a DSLR can get , but it &apos;s definitely a great achievement to develop a compact digital SLR camera and keep it easy to handle at the same time .
Nikon is continuing the concept of the D40 / D40x with the introduction of the Nikon D60 .
The resolution of the Nikon D60 remained the same ; with 10.2 Megapixels the camera sticks to the &apos; standard &apos; resolution for entry ##AT##-##AT## level digital SLR camera models .
The D60 uses the technology that has also been applied in the warmly welcomed D300 .
The EXPEED image processor inside the Nikon D60 ensures achieving the highest possible image quality as an end result .
The auto focus unit is Nikon &apos;s Multi ##AT##-##AT## CAM 530 AF sensor module with TTL phase detection and a 3 point AF system .
The image sensor delivers an ISO sensitivity of 100 - 1600 and offers the possibility to compensate the sensitivity with one extra step to ISO 3200 .
Compared with the D40x , the speed of action photography remained the same .
The 3 fps make Nikon keep pace with their competitors .
For a DSLR camera of the entry ##AT##-##AT## level segment this speed is sufficient for capturing fast moments .
A very important new feature for Nikon &apos;s entry ##AT##-##AT## level model is the integration of an anti ##AT##-##AT## dust system .
Such a system is always the first thing on a photographer &apos;s wish ##AT##-##AT## list while it prevents disappointments and a lot of editing afterwards .
That &apos;s why I am very pleased with the so ##AT##-##AT## called Airflow Control System since dust is an annoying phenomenon that every DSLR photographer has experienced in his photography career .
An additional novelty is the eye ##AT##-##AT## sensor deactivating the LCD monitor as soon as the optical viewfinder is used .
The energy consumption of the Nikon D60 will certainly benefit from this feature .
The wind has been with Nikon over the last few years .
The developments on the field of DSLR are fast but Nikon keep pace with great ease .
Products with important and great innovations appear in nearly every segment .
I can &apos;t say otherwise ; Nikon impress me hugely with what they have achieved lately .
An innovator like Nikon is enrichment for photography and adds greatly to the enthusiasm of amateur and professional photographers who are using their tools in a creative way .
I have had the possibility to test the new Nikon D60 in practice together with a Nikkor AF ##AT##-##AT## S DX 18 ##AT##-##AT## 55mm f / 3.5 ##AT##-##AT## 5.6 G VR lens .
Beforehand I qualified the D60 as a successor to the Nikon D40x but officially there is no mentioning of it being a successor .
We therefore will not say goodbye to the D40x but welcome a new Nikon family member ; the Nikon D60 .
My findings can be read in the following Nikon D60 review .

Hazrat Salaheddin Ali Nader Angha , Present Sufi Master of M.T.O.
Molana Salaheddin Ali Nader Angha , known as Hazrat Pir , is the 42nd Sufi in a continuous succession of Sufi Masters dating back 1400 years to the time of the Holy Prophet Muhammad ( peace and blessings upon him ) .
Esoteric knowledge was transmitted by the Holy Prophet of Islam to Imam Ali ( peace be upon him ) , Oveys Gharani ( Uways al ##AT##-##AT## Qarani ) , and Salman Farsi and then handed down through this unbroken chain of Sufi Masters to the present time .
Hazrat Pir was born in Tehran , Iran , on Sunday noon , the 30th of September 1945 .
His spiritual journey began in childhood , when special signs were seen in him .
For eleven years , he was under the tutelage of his grandfather , who was the 40th Sufi Master of the Oveyssi School .
He then pursued his studies under the direct guidance of his father , Molana ##AT##-##AT## al ##AT##-##AT## Moazam Hazrat Shah Maghsoud Sadegh Angha , known as Professor Angha .
On September 4 , 1970 , his father confirmed Nader Angha ’ s spiritual leadership with the Robe of Faqr .
Hazrat Shah Maghsoud , with a speech , handed over his Robe to him .
From the date of his appointment by the hand of his beloved father , Hazrat Pir assumed his responsibilities in carrying on the duties entrusted to him , which included the design and supervision of the construction of the magnificent Sufi Center in Sufi ##AT##-##AT## Abad of Karaj ( close to Tehran ) .
Dr. Ronald Grisell , who travelled to Iran in 1983 , sought and was granted permission to visit the Maktab Tarighat Oveyssi Shahmaghsoudi Oveyssi School at Sufi ##AT##-##AT## Abad of Karaj .
In 1979 , when Hazrat Pir moved to the United States with his father , he began to execute his father &apos;s wish to expand the sacred teachings to a wider audience .
In a short period of time and under his direct guidance and supervision , the teaching sessions started in many states of the USA .
In fact , after the passing away of Hazrat Shah Maghsoud , the duty of propagating the true message of Islam across the world rests on his shoulder .
Such a mission he has taken with such love and dedication and ceaselessly endeavor to guide , help and teach and reveal the true features of Islam to mankind , whatever their school of thought , creed or religions and upbringing .
Hazrat Pir &apos;s knowledge is not limited to the esoteric disciplines and sacred sciences ( science of letters and numbers , alchemy , etc . ) , but expands to other disciplines , including : physics , mathematics , astronomy , astrophysics , quantum mechanics , biophysics , philosophy , poetry , and architecture .
He has invented a device which produces Muon Rays to be used in Muontherapy to heal nerves and other systems in human bodies .
Hazrat Pir &apos;s insight , receptivity , and meticulous mind have won the respect of scholars and scientists around the world .
Hazrat Pir has delivered lectures at many of the leading universities in the West , and at other scientific and educational institutions .
His discourses focus on presenting the depth of the spirituality in Islam , its scientific richness , and its relevance for contemporary life .
It is his conviction that unless each person &apos;s inherent goodness , talents , and abilities are developed , one cannot know the meaning of stability , security , freedom and human dignity .
Hazrat Pir &apos;s more than 50 books include works of prose and poetry - Peace , The Secret Word , The Approaching Promise , Masnavi Ravayeh , Whispering Moments , The Fragrance of Sufism , Sufism , Sufism and Peace , Sufism and Knowledge , Sufism and Wisdom , Sufism and Islam , Theory &quot; I &quot; , Sufism the Reality of Religion , Sufism the Bridge between Religions , and Dahm .
Professor Angha &apos;s love , trust , and respect for his son was so great that he spoke of him with unbounded tenderness in his numerous books , including , Serr ##AT##-##AT## ol Hajar , Hamase ##AT##-##AT## ye Hayat , Masnavi Shahed va Mashhood , Seyr ##AT##-##AT## al Sa &apos;er va Teyr al ##AT##-##AT## Nader , Al ##AT##-##AT## Rasa &apos;el , and Principles of Faghr and Sufism .
Absolute , devastating submission of the hearts , is it ?
Still , the celebrated gems of which the legends sing ?
Or is it the surging ocean ?
In the above verse , when mentioning &quot; Molana , &quot; Professor Angha alludes to a poem that Rumi wrote about Hazrat Pir .
In the Sufi tradition , Sufi Masters are known to have the spiritual expansiveness to behold future events even though they may be many centuries ahead .
The love of the beloved , creativity of creation , and enlivener of the soul .
Issued not from the earth , but from the highest heavens .
The stars above question , &quot; what is this brilliant sun ?
The fish in the sea say , &quot; what cataclysmic event is this ?
The lustrous moon ’ s envy is this brilliant sun ’ s light .
The mysterious Mount ’ s summit and most precious , and Nader Angha is he .
This light of vision is the light of Molana ’ s soul .
The might of God and our king , his warrior is he .
Bearer of woes , guardian of tomorrows is he .
What song is this that beckons all hearts ?
I tell you then , the jewel of God ’ s sea is he .
Reference is made to Joseph , the favorite son of Jacob who was thrown in a well by his envious brothers and later sold as a slave to the Egyptians .
Known for his unequalled beauty , he became the symbol of beauty in Sufi literature .

SqlBuilder is a very useful Open Source ( C # ) tool for all developers , which work with databases .
SqlBuilder makes working on SQL servers much easier .
One intention of SqlBuilder is , not to need the primitive and awkward Microsoft SQL tools anymore .
SqlBuilder has a complicated Syntax Parser , which does not only display SQL commands in colors but also automatically converts badly written code into readable code .
Long SQL commands like SELECT are wraped automatically in an intelligent way onto multiple lines and are indented .
The parsing happens during entering text .
Normally you have to pay much money for this functionality .
Additionally SqlBuilder reads automatically stored procedures , views , functions and trigger from the server and allows to edit and store them .
Any SQL command can be executed and the result is displayed as ( a ) table ( s ) .
All procedures , views , functions , triggers and table definitions can be saved in seconds as ##STAR## .SQL files .
huge SQL file for the next release , which is given to the client to execute it to update his server .
A detailed documentation can be found in the download of the sourcecode .
A FTP program for special needs .
Joining splitted archives , download of only a specific part of a file , scheduler , bandwidth control , preview function , and more ...
This program creates PowerPoint presentations fully automated based on XML templates and dynamic data which may come for example from a database .
CabLib is an Open Source library , which allows compressing and extracting files into CAB archives .
CAB archives have a better compression ratio than ZIP archives .
CabLib exists in 2 versions : A code , which can be integrated into C + + programs or as a DLL ( assembly ) , which can be integrated into all .NET projects .
CabLib supports Unicode and encryption of data .
CabLib can directly extract a CAB file from a server - also partial downloads .
This project is based on CabLib : an installer , which installs or updates huge software projects - also per internet , directly from a server .
Additionally it contains an universal Multi ##AT##-##AT## Language class , with which any .NET project easily supports any number of languages .
DHTML Editor is a C + + library for Visual Studio 6 or higher , which integrates Internet Explorer as a control into your application , so that it displays HTML content and allows to edit it .
With this library you can add a comfortable HTML editor to any C + + application , ( like in Outlook Express ) which also allows creating tables .
With this library you can add comfortable callbacks and signals and slots ( = events ) to your C + + application .
Cuttermaran is a program , with which you can cut MPEG video films ( DVB = digital television ) .
If you are new to .NET C # or Visual Basic I recommend to download 101 sample sourcecodes from Microsoft . Even if you are an experienced .NET programmer and want to program something which you never did before ( for example .NET Remoting , Internet Explorer automation , database acces ... ) you find sample code for nearly everything you can do with .NET.
If you want to check your Virus Scanner , you can do that with the encrypted archive AntiVirusChecker.zip.
It contains 75 infected files , which your virus scanner should detect .
If you search for a freeware scanner , I recommend BitDefender version 8 .
Here you find the results of a test with Norton , Bitdefender , AntiVir , Kaspersky , Trendmicro , Norman , Sophos , F ##AT##-##AT## Secure and Avast .
As you see : the perfect virus scanner does not exist !
Generally you should NEVER rely on your virus scanner and combine it with a tool like ProcessGuard ( see below ) , which also protects against very new virus / worms without requiring a database , which must be updated permanently .
As an alternative I recommend VirusTotal where you can upload a suspicious file and VirusTotal checks it with 37 actual virus scanners !
All these programs have one thing in common : they are high quality software and they are easy to use .
Sadly the DiamondCS website is dead .
Runs deep in the operating system and observes all running processes .
Displays all open TCP and UDP ports , packet sniffer , bandwidth throttle , trojan detection .
AutoStartViewer shows , what progs are started when booting ( MUCH more than other tools show !
Detects thousands of Trojans which are not detected by virus scanners , RAT server , keylogger .
Even if your hardddisk is stolen nobody can read your data .
If you &apos;re still wasting your time with the Windows Explorer , you simply don &apos;t know Windows Commander !
The WinCommander joins a File Manager , a FTP client , a packer / unpacker and more in one program .
So it replaces at least Windows Explorer , WinZip and a FTP program .
Context menu ( right mouse button ) of Explorer available .
Opening ZIP , RAR , ARJ , LZH , TAR , GZ , CAB , and ACE and display of the content as a subfolder .
If you are sick of all the security holes and the never ending updates of Internet Explorer and Outlook Express , then I recommend Mozilla Firefox ( browser ) and Mozilla Thunderbird ( email programm ) .
In Thunderbird you have to get used to the different account and folder management .
After importing the Outlook Express addressbook you will note the all subfolders in the addressbook are gone .
( all addresses are in one folder ) The reason for that is not Thunderbird but Microsoft !
There is also a portable version avaible of Thunderbird which runs from memorystick and stores your emails on memorystick .
It loads much faster and without splash screen .
You can make annotations in the PDF document ( e.g. underline text , add your own text , see screenshot ) and save these to disk or print them out .
You may convert the whole PDF document into a simple text file .
Your browser will never again crash or hang while you open a PDF document on a webpage because FoxitReader will always open PDFs in an own process and not in a browser window .
Foxit PDF Creator allows you to convert non ##AT##-##AT## PDF file into PDF file .
Foxit PDF Editor allows you to modify content of a PDF file .
PDF Factory is a Printer Driver , which allows to convert any document ( e.g. from MS Word ) , which is sent to the printer , into a PDF document .
Interesting side effect : If you have a protected PDF document , which does not allow to copy text from it , you only have to &quot; print &quot; this document to PDF Factory and you get the same document but without protection .
ExpressTalk offers telephone conferences , an addressbook , an answering machine , video transfer , recording of calls and a lot more .
More and more providers offer an Internet telephony flatrate . For Germany I recommend Sipgate.de , where you get a real telephone number in the fixed line network .
Obviously calls to other SIP telephones are ALWAYS free , no matter where they are in the world .
If you don &apos;t want to have your PC running all the time just to telephone you can buy the cheap SIP telephone GrandStream BT ##AT##-##AT## 101 ( Screenshot ) which is connected directly with your DSL router or LAN . It can be configured comfortably via web interface .
With the freeware programm PGP 8 you can encrypt emails , files and network connections with up to 2048 bit keys .
You can also create self ##AT##-##AT## extracting encrypted archives ( EXE ) , which will only decrypt after entering the correct passphrase .
An additional feature is PGPdisk , which creates an encrypted drive .
This drive appears as a normal drive with files and folders in it .
But all data in this drive is stored in one single encrypted file .
To open this drive you have to enter the passphrase .
Form version 8 on you can trust PGP again as the source ##AT##-##AT## code is published .
From version 9 on PGP is not freeware anymore , for that you can download version 8 here .
Detailed ( German ) information about PGP available at Kai Raven &apos;s homepage .
You should use words , which don &apos;t exist in dictionaries and use lower case and upper case letters at a wrong position in a word and include numbers . Also you should never write down your passphrase anywhere !
With the freeware program TrueCrpyt you can create encrypted volumes .
These can be based either on a single encrypted file or you can encrypt an entire partition .
After entering the correct passphrase you can read and write the encrypted ( virtual ) volume in exactly the same way as any other ( real ) volume .
If someone steals your harddisk , nobody can read your data .
You can also burn a 4,5 GB encrypted file onto a DVD together with the tiny TrueCrypt program ( 800 kB ) .
Then you can put this DVD into any computer , start TrueCrypt without installation directly from the DVD , enter the passphrase and the content of the DVD will open in a new Windows volume ( e.g. drive M : ) with all its directories and files as you have created it before .
Truecrypt can even encrypt your entire Windows partition while Windows is running !
TrueCrypt offers the same security as PGP .
TeamViewer is a Remote Administration Tool , which allows to connect with another computer ( even PC with MAC ) and remote ##AT##-##AT## control it .
You can also show your desktop to your colleagues in a team session .
The special feature of Teamviewer is , that in contrast to a Windows Remote ##AT##-##AT## Desktop connection it allows to connect via Internet , even if both computers are behind a firewall !
This is possible because Teamviewer connects to a server , which assigns a unique user identifier to each user . Then you give this number to your partner to connect .
You do not need any administrator privileges to run the program , it runs without installation .
Additionally Teamviewer has a file ##AT##-##AT## transfer module and also functions within local networks without internet access .
ACDSee is a Graphic browser , that supports all graphic formats ( also animated graphics ) With the space bar you can jump to the next image on your hard disk / CD .
The program adapts to the size of the image or can be used in fullsreen mode to make a slide show .
The Thumbnail view gives a quick overview about all images in a folder .
If you are looking for a software to not only display the images and videos from your digital camera but also edit and manage them , I recommend the shareware ACDSee version 8 or the Freeware Faststone Image Viewer which shows the fotos also on a beamer .
At Doom9 you find software and guides to ripp DVD &apos;s , convert them to Video CD , AVI , MPEG or DivX , to cut and play films .... etc .

Simply drag and drop the files you want to write to CD / DVD onto the drive in Explorer .
Then you can use the CD / DVD like a movable drive .
InCD will automatically mount each formatted CD / DVD which you put into the drive .
DVD Ram &apos;s can be overwritten 100.000 times ( 100 times as much as CD RW &apos;s ) and are currently available as single sided with 4.7 GB or double sided with 9.4 GB with or without cartridge .
Not all burners support DVD Ram !

Olympus products can be used for a wide variety of thickness measurement , flaw detection , and condition monitoring tests in pipes and tanks .
Thickness gaging and flaw detection can usually be performed from the outside and often at elevated temperature , without requiring draining , disassembly , or process shutdown .
The rugged design of equipment from Olympus allows it to perform in even the toughest environments , providing cost ##AT##-##AT## effective inspection solutions without teardown .
Ultrasonic flaw detectors and phased array systems are widely used for monitoring the integrity of pipes , tanks , heat exchangers , and structural metals throughout the energy and chemical industries , including detection of hydrogen cracking and similar forms of intergranular weakening , and for pipeline weld inspection .
Hand ##AT##-##AT## held ultrasonic thickness gages are widely used for corrosion monitoring .
Eddy current instruments are used in the oil and petrochemical industries primarily for the inspection of in service tubing , including tube bundles that are used for cooling processes .
Often these tube bundles can be several thousand tubes , each of which must be inspected for pitting , cracking , wear , and corrosion , and eddy current makes this a relatively fast process .
Eddy current array technology quickens the process even further .
Eddy current array technologies are also being developed for detecting cracking , particularly chloride stress corrosion cracking .
Videoscopes , fiberscopes and borescopes are used throughout many different types of plant , for instance in condenser tubes , heat exchangers and tubes , pipelines , steam and power turbines , pumps , gearboxes , compressors , boilers , headers and valves .
Olympus RVI equipment can be used for condition monitoring , by means of integral or optional photo ##AT##-##AT## documentation systems , including advanced digital image management software , and by measurement via videoscopes and borescopes , allowing accurate assessment of defect length , width and depth .

In applications such as plastic containers , the operator simply drops the small target ball inside the container .
The magnetic probe held on the outsider of the container attracts the target ball .
When the operator scans the probe along the surface or critical corners , the small steel target ball will follow .
In the Minimum Mode feature , the gage continually displays both the actual thickness and the lowest thickness reading .
The Magna ##AT##-##AT## Mike 8500 is the ideal instrument for measuring difficult shapes and sizes .
Nondestructive measurement capabilities allow for pinpoint thickness readings in tight corners and grooves down to a radius of 1 / 32 &quot; .
The Magna ##AT##-##AT## Mike has been successfully integrated into quality control programs for glass and aluminum containers , aerospace composite parts , medical packaging , automotive panels , airbag tear seams , and other parts made from nonferrous materials .
Industrial XY ( motorized and manual ) and manual weld inspection scanners provide reliable , accurate performance in a wide range of heavy duty industrial applications in which scanners are used to improve quality and reduce costs .

Outputs a large amount of information about the current state of PHP .
This includes information about PHP compilation options and extensions , the PHP version , server information and environment ( if compiled as a module ) , the PHP environment , OS version information , paths , master and local values of configuration options , HTTP headers , and the PHP License .
Because every system is setup differently , phpinfo ( ) is commonly used to check configuration settings and for available predefined variables on a given system .
phpinfo ( ) is also a valuable debugging tool as it contains all EGPCS ( Environment , GET , POST , Cookie , Server ) data .
One can also combine the respective constants or bitwise values together with the or operator .
Loaded modules and their respective settings .
Shows all predefined variables from EGPCS ( Environment , GET , POST , Cookie , Server ) .
The &quot; Loaded Configuration File &quot; information was added , when before only &quot; Configuration File ( php.ini ) Path &quot; existed .
Note : Parts of the information displayed are disabled when the expose ##UNDERSCORE## php configuration setting is set to off .
This includes the PHP and Zend logos , and the credits .
Note : phpinfo ( ) outputs plain text instead of HTML when using the CLI mode .
There are quite a few functions that do not fit into the DOM standard and should no longer be used .
These functions are listed in the following table .
The function DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## append ##UNDERSCORE## child ( ) has changed its behaviour . It now adds a child and not a sibling .
If this breaks your application , use the non ##AT##-##AT## DOM function DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## append ##UNDERSCORE## sibling ( ) .
Create a new node with e.g. DomDocument ##UNDERSCORE## create ##UNDERSCORE## element ( ) and add it with DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## append ##UNDERSCORE## child ( ) .
Create a new node with e.g. DomDocument ##UNDERSCORE## create ##UNDERSCORE## text ##UNDERSCORE## node ( ) and add it with DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## append ##UNDERSCORE## child ( ) .
Content is just a text node and can be accessed with DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## child ##UNDERSCORE## nodes ( ) .
Content is just a text node and can be added with DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## append ##UNDERSCORE## child ( ) .
The API of the module follows the DOM Level 2 standard as closely as possible .
It is a good idea to have the DOM standard available when using this module .
Though the API is object ##AT##-##AT## oriented , there are many functions which can be called in a non ##AT##-##AT## object ##AT##-##AT## oriented way by passing the object to operate on as the first argument .
These functions are mainly to retain compatibility to older versions of the extension , and should not be used when creating new scripts .
This API differs from the official DOM API in two ways .
First , all class attributes are implemented as functions with the same name .
Secondly , the function names follow the PHP naming convention .
This means that a DOM function lastChild ( ) will be written as last ##UNDERSCORE## child ( ) .
This module defines a number of classes , which are listed - including their method - in the following tables .
Classes with an equivalent in the DOM standard are named DOMxxx .
This function emulates the former behaviour of DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## append ##UNDERSCORE## child ( ) .
Many examples in this reference require an XML string .
Instead of repeating this string in every example , it will be put into a file which will be included by each example .
This include file is shown in the following example section .
Alternatively , you could create an XML document and read it with DomDocument ##UNDERSCORE## open ##UNDERSCORE## file ( ) .
even the SimpleXML functions are object ##AT##-##AT## oriented , which doesn &apos;t work for some of my purposes ( sending to a Smarty template variable for looping through , etc . ) -- returning attributes as SimpleXMLElement objects instead of strings , etc .. i just wanted an ARRAY containing the data as STRINGS .

Hotblooded Pakistani Raqia Khan &amp; the psychopathic rap ##AT##-##AT## crooner Splatterdandy sing about fake compliments and greetings from the universe , about perfect romance and gas intoxication , about porno , politics and power .
Even the German Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel becomes dancable : The new German national anthem &quot; Hart Durchregieren &quot; ( which means as much as &quot; Rule Hard &quot; ) , where Khan performs as a Russian domina , takes up a demand of Angela Merkel , while &quot; Unterschicht &quot; dismantles a decade of political reforms with sex in a social welfare center .
Thus they bring porno into politics , politics back into porn and intelligent statements back into the underground .
In explicit openness they sing about Berlin , a city , which is built on blood , about meetings with zombies and strange orgies .
The sound is hard , sensitive and dancable , mixing seventies disco , US ##AT##-##AT## west ##AT##-##AT## coast rap , house , soul and dirty funk .

The record is for the most dominoes toppled in a chain reaction .
The pushover must start from a single point . Once the chain reaction ends , the attempt is over .
It is not important how many dominoes were set up - just the number of dominoes which fall counts .
On 17 January 2004 , at the opening of the Weser tunnel in Germany , a brick toppling record was set when approximately 1,500 volunteers built a line of bricks ( weighing 2 kg each ) from Bremerhaven to Nordenham , a distance of almost 27 km &#91; 16.78 miles &#93; .
Starting in Atlanta , the chain reaction continued through Rio de Janeiro , London , Nairobi , Tokyo , Sydney , finishing back in Atlanta .
The first domino at each site was triggered by an electronic signal relayed from a switch activated by the last domino at the prior site . Team members : John Wickham , Scott Suko , Michael Cairney , Erez Klein , Akira Enomoto , Daniel Beckerleg .
In the keynote address by the EPA , they announced that there was an epidemic of multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus , and they did not understand what toxin was causing this to be rampant across the United States . I explained I was there to lecture on exactly that subject .
When the temperature of Aspartame exceeds 86 degrees F , the wood alcohol in ASPARTAME coverts to formaldehyde and then to formic acid , which in turn causes metabolic acidosis . ( Formic acid is the poison found in the sting of fire ants .
) The methanol toxicity mimics multiple sclerosis ; thus , people were being diagnosed with having multiple sclerosis in error . The multiple sclerosis is not a death sentence , where methanol toxicity is .
In the cases of systemic lupus , which is triggered by ASPARTAME , the victim usually does not know that the aspartame is the culprit . The victim continues its use aggravating the lupus to such a degree , that sometimes it becomes life threatening .
During a visit to a hospice , a nurse said that six of her friends , who were heavy Diet Coke drinkers , had all been diagnosed with MS. This is beyond coincidence .
Now there are over 5,000 products containing this chemical , and the PATENT HAS EXPIRED ! ! ! !
Formaldehyde is grouped in the same class of drugs as cyanide and arsenic - DEADLY POISONS ! ! ! Unfortunately , it just takes longer to quietly kill , but it is killing people and causing all kinds of neurological problems .
The Congressional record said , &quot; It makes you crave Carbohydrates and will make you FAT . &quot; Dr. Roberts stated that when he got patients off aspartame , their average weight loss was 19 pounds per person .
We find that physicians believe that they have patients with retinopathy , when in fact , it is caused by the aspartame . The aspartame keeps the blood sugar level out of control , causing many patients to go into a coma .
People were telling us at the conference of the American College of Physicians , that they had relatives that switched from saccharin to an aspartame product and how that relative had eventually gone into a coma .
Their physicians could not get the blood sugar levels under control .
Dr. Blaylock has written a book entitled &quot; EXCITOTOXINS : THE TASTE THAT KILLS &quot; Health Press 1 ##AT##-##AT## 800 ##AT##-##AT## 643 ##AT##-##AT## 2665 ) . Dr. H. J. Roberts , diabetic specialist and world expert on aspartame poisoning , has also written a book entitled &quot; DEFENSE AGAINST ALZHEIMER &apos;S DISEASE &quot; ( 1 ##AT##-##AT## 800 ##AT##-##AT## 814 ##AT##-##AT## 9800 ) .
He said , &quot; His diabetic patients presented memory loss , confusion , and severe vision loss . &quot; At the Conference of the American College of Physicians , doctors admitted that they did not know .
This &quot; poison &quot; is now available in 90 PLUS countries worldwide .
Take the &quot; NO ASPARTAME TEST &quot; and send us your case history . I assure you that MONSANTO , the creator of Aspart ame , knows how deadly it is .
The New York Times , November 15 , 1996 , ran an article on how the American Dietetic Association takes money from the food industry to endorse their products .
Therefore , they cannot criticize any additives or tell about their link to MONSANTO .
The child was having grand mal seizures every day . The mother called her physician , who called the ADA , who told the doctor not to take the child off the NutraSweet .
We are still trying to convince the mother that the Aspartame is causing the seizures . Every time we get someone off of aspartame , the seizures stop .
Aspartame Disease is partially the cause to what is behind some of the mystery of the Desert Storm health problems . The burning tongue and other problems discussed in over 60 cases can be directly related to the consumption of Aspartame product .
Several thousand pallets of diet drinks were shipped to the Desert Storm troops . ( Remember heat can liberate the methanol from the aspartame at 86 degrees F. ) Diet drinks sat in the 120 degree F Arabian sun for weeks at a time on pallets The servicemen and women drank them all day long .
There are a lot of people out there who must be warned , please let them know this information .

Emily Grose , daughter of Canadian Rotarian Ed Grose , befriended other children while accompanying her parents on a Rotary ##AT##-##AT## related trip to Uganda in 2004 .
The trip inspired a Matching Grant project that Grose is coordinating for his club .
One of the most sobering facts about malaria is that it can be prevented simply by sleeping under an insecticide ##AT##-##AT## treated mosquito net .
These nets can last five years and cost about US $ 10 -- expensive to families who survive on less than $ 1 a day but , thanks to Rotarian efforts , now accessible to many of them .
The Rotary Club of Kråkerøy , Norway , teamed up with the Rotary Club of Machakos , Kenya , in 2004 on a $ 16,000 Matching Grant project to distribute 3,000 mosquito nets to children under five and pregnant women in a slum of Machakos and nearby rural villages .
Malaria prevention often fits in with larger community development ventures .

The challenges for mobility are growing constantly .
The concentration of an increasingly older world population in urban areas , which are growing at an ever faster pace , poses a tremendous challenge for mobility in the future .
More than ever before , the quality of life and competitiveness of whole regions will depend upon safe and fast public transportation .
Only a service provider who can focus on everything – from infrastructure to vehicles , from planning to after ##AT##-##AT## sales service – can provide the answer to this challenge : namely , through the sensible coordination of all modes of transportation , tailored to specific mobility requirements .
Where required , as a complete and ready ##AT##-##AT## made solution from a single source .
Come aboard and enjoy the world of Complete mobility .
Perfect solutions are distinguished by their broad focus .
Swiftly traveling across country to destination .
Taking time out for oneself or someone else .
Arrive at their destinations refreshed and relaxed ?
Even on longer journeys , time flies by with Desiro ML .
Everyone glides along smoothly without turbulence thanks to the air ##AT##-##AT## sprung bogies and comfortable seats adapted for long distances .
Combining ultramodern technology with service ##AT##-##AT## proven equipment and designed to meet the requirements of existing and future norms , the Desiro ML platform is setting new standards in modern rail ##AT##-##AT## based transportation .
Standards typified by low ##AT##-##AT## floor seating arrangements , generously apportioned doorways and gangways , an attractive , innovative design , and maximum passenger comfort .
In every aspect of its design , equipment and modular interior , the Desiro ML goes one step further with the level comfort .
Innovative , variable solutions for passengers and driver not only meet but exceed expectations for an attractive mass transit system .
Journeys are so pleasurable that by the time they leave the train , passengers will be already looking forward to their next ride on the Desiro ML .
The profitability of a transportation system is a lot more than simply looking at the costs of purchase and operation .
Here again , the temporarily coupled unit concept of the Desiro ML has the edge on permanently coupled trains .
And that starts with its higher capacity : its longer car length gives a 3 ##AT##-##AT## car Desiro ML more seats than an articulated train of the same length with the same seat spacing .
When you go on a journey , you want to reach your destination safely .
Commuter , regional and InterRegio services with passenger appeal are closely associated with relaxation and feeling safe .
That ’ s why safety is an integral part of the Desiro ML train concept .
It offers responsible interaction with our environment and reassurance for the operators that statutory regulations will be met now and in the future .
Are you looking for a partner who will guide you , reliably and competently , every step of the way , from your first decision to buy , through the planning stage , to a complete aftersales service ?
Over the last 160 years , Siemens has established a proven track record in project management .
The vast knowledge acquired by the company over this time has been used to advantage for the Desiro ML .
Manufacturers and operators of rail ##AT##-##AT## based transportation systems face two new trends : shorter lead times and rising cost pressure .
This has a knock ##AT##-##AT## on effect on inspection and testing , for new rail systems have to be operationally ready and reliable from day one .

On the Canaries , the islands themselves are the greatest treasure .
So close to each other and yet so different , they all boast the most incredible landscapes so the visitor can explore all the facets of an amazing and fanciful natural world .
Here you will find a unique rural setting where you will encounter volcanoes with magical landscapes created by lava , untamed woodlands , pinewoods , immense expanses of dunes , coastlines and mountainous areas , in spaces that are protected because of their rich bio ##AT##-##AT## diversity and their numerous indigenous species which include dragon trees , junipers and viper &apos;s bugloss .
Rural tourism on the islands is a unique experience .
You can stay at houses that conserve all the flavour of days gone by or in small , friendly hotels with a family atmosphere ; in the mountains or in picturesque villages where hospitality is a tradition ; near the sea or in the silence of the countryside - it is up to you .
The gentle temperatures of the islands enable you to enjoy all the open ##AT##-##AT## air leisure options 365 days a year : you can follow the footpaths on foot , on horseback or riding a camel , make a bicycle tour or go canyoning down the ravines that are brimming with vegetation ; or explore the mysteries of the volcanic tubes , climb incredible walls of rock or dive in the crystal ##AT##-##AT## clear waters and find yourself surrounded by rays and amberjacks .
From the air , the Canary Islands are just as spectacular . There is nothing better than to para ##AT##-##AT## glide over the mountains and beaches in order to absorb all their beauty .
The Canary Islands are part of the region of Macaronesia , one of the most important in the world for their rich bio ##AT##-##AT## diversity . Exclusive to this region is laurisilva , a virgin laurel woodland which once covered the entire Mediterranean basin and which has its last redoubt here .
The Canaries have 141 protected areas , four of which are are National Parks .
There are four Biosphere Reserves and a total of 1,386 native plants , 546 of which are peculiar to these Islands .
The clarity of the sky and limited light contamination have led to the installation of two international astronomical observatories from which , among others , significant solar studies are carried out .
The Archipelago has hundreds of volcanoes and a rich variety of ecosystems and microclimates , which enable certain protected animals to survive such as the white ##AT##-##AT## tailed and Bolle &apos;s laurel pigeons , the Canarian lizard known as the tizón , the blue chaffinch and the osprey .

Test specifications for the CANoe test execution machine can be programmed in a simple programming language ( CAPL ) specially tailored for testing distributed systems , or they can be defined in an XML language .
The structure of the test specification is identical in both cases .
The stimulation and evaluation of events needed to test ECU functionality are encapsulated in test cases .
The overall test specification is referred to as a test module .
On the test module , test groups or test cases level additional conditions can be formulated ( Invariants ) .
These conditions are evaluated in the particular context in parallel to the actual test execution .
The supplemental test and stimulus functions contained in the Test Service Library ( TSL ) simplify setup and execution of your own test scenarios . Besides supporting automated tests , CANoe also supports manual execution of test cases , e.g.

Cyclomatic complexity ( also referred as program complexity or McCabe ´ s complexity ) is the most widely used member of a class of static software metrics .
It may be considered a broad measure of soundness and confidence for a program .
The cyclomatic complexity has been introduced by Thomas McCabe in 1976 .
It measures the number of linearly ##AT##-##AT## independent paths through a program module .
The McCabe complexity is one of the more widely ##AT##-##AT## accepted software metrics , it is intended to be independent of language and language format .
McCabe &apos;s Cyclomatic number v ( G ) shows the complexity of the flow of control through a piece of code .
v ( G ) is the number of conditional branches in the flowchart .
v ( G ) = 1 for a program consisting of only sequential statements .
For a single function ; v ( G ) is one less than the number of conditional branching points in the function .
The greater the cyclomatic number is the more execution paths there are through the function , and the harder it is to understand .
Note , that the cyclomatic number is insensitive to the complexity of data structures , data flows , and module interfaces .
When dynamic testing is concerned , the cyclomatic number v ( G ) is one of the most important complexity measures .
Because the cyclomatic number describes the control flow complexity , it is obvious that modules and functions having high cyclomatic number need more test cases than modules having a lower cyclomatic number .
As a rule of thumb , each function should have at least as many test cases as indicated by its cyclomatic number .
The cyclomatic number of a function should be less than 15 .
If a function has a cyclomatic number of 15 , there are at least 15 ( but probably more ) execution paths through it .
More than 15 paths are hard to identify and test .
Functions containing one selection statement with many branches make up an exception .
A reasonable upper limit Cyclomatic number of a file is 100 .
McCabe Cyclomatic number v ( G ) is calculated on ( member ) function definitions and on class / struct declarations . It is also calculated on the entire source file .
Each if ##AT##-##AT## statement introduces a new branch to the program and therefore increases v ( G ) by one .
Iteration constructs such as for- and while ##AT##-##AT## loops also introduce branches .
Each case ... : part in the switch ##AT##-##AT## statement increase the v ( G ) by one .
Case branch does not increase v ( G ) , because it does not increase the number of branches in the control flow .
If there are two or more case ... : parts that have no code in between , the McCabe measure is increased only with one for all those case ... : parts .
Each catch ( ... ) part in a try ##AT##-##AT## block increases v ( G ) by one .
It should be noted that v ( G ) is insensitive to unconditional branches like goto- , return- and break ##AT##-##AT## statements although they surely increase complexity .
In CMT + + the branches generated by conditional compilation directives are also counted to v ( G ) .
Even if conditional compilation directives do not add branches to the control flow of the executable program , they increase the complexity of the program file that the user sees and edits .
In summary , the following language constructs increase the cyclomatic number by one : if ( ... ) , for ( ... ) , while ( ... ) , case ... : , catch ( ... ) , &amp; &amp; , &#124; &#124; , ? , # if , # ifdef , # ifndef , # elif .

PHP provides a large number of predefined variables to all scripts .
The variables represent everything from external variables to built ##AT##-##AT## in environment variables , last error messages to last retrieved headers .
See also the FAQ titled &quot; How does register ##UNDERSCORE## globals affect me ?
header ( ) is used to send a raw HTTP header .
See the » HTTP / 1.1 specification for more information on HTTP headers .
Remember that header ( ) must be called before any actual output is sent , either by normal HTML tags , blank lines in a file , or from PHP .
It is a very common error to read code with include ( ) , or require ( ) , functions , or another file access function , and have spaces or empty lines that are output before header ( ) is called .
The same problem exists when using a single PHP / HTML file .
The first is a header that starts with the string &quot; HTTP / &quot; ( case is not significant ) , which will be used to figure out the HTTP status code to send .
For example , if you have configured Apache to use a PHP script to handle requests for missing files ( using the ErrorDocument directive ) , you may want to make sure that your script generates the proper status code .
The second special case is the &quot; Location : &quot; header .
Not only does it send this header back to the browser , but it also returns a REDIRECT ( 302 ) status code to the browser unless some 3xx status code has already been set .
parameter indicates whether the header should replace a previous similar header , or add a second header of the same type .
as the second argument you can force multiple headers of the same type .
This function now prevents more than one header to be sent at once as a protection against header injection attacks .
If you want the user to be prompted to save the data you are sending , such as a generated PDF file , you can use the » Content ##AT##-##AT## Disposition header to supply a recommended filename and force the browser to display the save dialog .
PHP scripts often generate dynamic content that must not be cached by the client browser or any proxy caches between the server and the client browser .
Note : You may find that your pages aren &apos;t cached even if you don &apos;t output all of the headers above .
There are a number of options that users may be able to set for their browser that change its default caching behavior .
By sending the headers above , you should override any settings that may otherwise cause the output of your script to be cached .
Additionally , session ##UNDERSCORE## cache ##UNDERSCORE## limiter ( ) and the session.cache ##UNDERSCORE## limiter configuration setting can be used to automatically generate the correct caching ##AT##-##AT## related headers when sessions are being used .
Note : As of PHP 4 , you can use output buffering to get around this problem , with the overhead of all of your output to the browser being buffered in the server until you send it .
Note : The HTTP status header line will always be the first sent to the client , regardless of the actual header ( ) call being the first or not .
The status may be overridden by calling header ( ) with a new status line at any time unless the HTTP headers have already been sent .
Note : There is a bug in Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 that prevents this from working . There is no workaround .
There is also a bug in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 that interferes with this , which can be resolved by upgrading to Service Pack 2 or later .
Note : If safe mode is enabled the uid of the script is added to the realm part of the WWW ##AT##-##AT## Authenticate header if you set this header ( used for HTTP Authentication ) .
Note : HTTP / 1.1 requires an absolute URI as argument to » Location : including the scheme , hostname and absolute path , but some clients accept relative URIs .
Note : Session ID is not passed with Location header even if session.use ##UNDERSCORE## trans ##UNDERSCORE## sid is enabled .

Deadlocks are a classic problem in transactional databases , but they are not dangerous unless they are so frequent that you cannot run certain transactions at all .
Normally , you must write your applications so that they are always prepared to re ##AT##-##AT## issue a transaction if it gets rolled back because of a deadlock .
You can get deadlocks even in the case of transactions that just insert or delete a single row .
That is because these operations are not really “ atomic ” ; they automatically set locks on the ( possibly several ) index records of the row inserted or deleted .
to determine the cause of the latest deadlock .
That can help you to tune your application to avoid deadlocks .
Always be prepared to re ##AT##-##AT## issue a transaction if it fails due to deadlock .
Small transactions are less prone to collision .
Access your tables and rows in a fixed order .
Then transactions form well ##AT##-##AT## defined queues and do not deadlock .
Then your queries need to scan fewer index records and consequently set fewer locks .
to determine which indexes the MySQL server regards as the most appropriate for your queries .
isolation level is good here , because each consistent read within the same transaction reads from its own fresh snapshot .
If nothing else helps , serialize your transactions with table ##AT##-##AT## level locks .

Software is codified power in the digital domain .
In other words -- to quote Stanford Professor Lawrence Lessig -- Code is a regulator that governs cyberspace in ways similar to Law governing the real world .
In the Northern world , most people are already depending upon software for very basic tasks of communication , education and work .
The grade of dependency is generally lower in the Southern world today .
But if the digital literacy and inclusion projects show the intended effect , the dependency will be as high , potentially even higher , as many areas aim to skip the intermediate steps of analog infrastructure and directly enter the digital world .
Much of this interaction with and dependency upon software remains unreflected and in fact unnoticed -- fulfilling a prediction that Professor Weizenbaum of MIT made many years ago . Unless sitting in front of a physical machine explicitly marked as &quot; Computer &quot; , the majority of users will often remain unaware of using software .
A common example for this are mobile phones .
With the trend towards ambient computing , this effect is likely to increase .
While access to software determines our ability to participate in a digital society and governs our ability for communication , education and work , software itself represents a reservoir of codified skill .
Software allows humankind to collectively refine and exercise sets of codified skills that most of the individuals do not possess .
An example are graphical applications , which in the scope of complex image editing make complex mathematical transformations like Fast Fourier Transformation ( FFT ) available to everyone capable of understanding the applications &apos; menu symbols .
While the issues of software are centrally connected to many of the issues discussed during the World Summit on the Information Society , the lack of awareness on all sides for software as the cultural technique of the digital age often complicated the situation .
While most governments often see software from a purely economic perspective , some large industrial players have begun understanding the amount of political power embedded in it .
By propertizing the software , they gain almost absolute control over the users -- be they private people , other companies or governments -- and the rules these have to obey .
Proprietary software always remains under control of the licensor of the software , not the user .
And in a networked world , that control can even be remotely exercised -- independent of whether the user of the software is an individual or a government .
That dependency on proprietary software is infectious .
Protocols are kept secret , standards are being broken .
These protocols are not secret because they are valuable , they draw their value from being secret .
The company Microsoft poses a very good example for both cases , as the European Commission antitrust case and the modification of the Kerberos standard have shown .
The countermodel to proprietary software is based on breaking that dependency and putting an equal amount of power into the hands of all people .
It is defined by four fundamental freedoms : the freedom of unlimited use for any purpose , the freedom to study , the freedom to modify and the freedom to distribute the software both in original and modified form .
The original name for this model is Free Software .
It is sometimes also referred to as &quot; Open Source &quot; , a marketing synonym proposed in 1998 to attract venture capital that is frequently abused these days to sell proprietary software under the guise of Free Software .
Other synonyms frequently encountered are &quot; FOSS &quot; -- for &quot; Free and Open Source Software &quot; -- and &quot; FLOSS &quot; -- for &quot; Free , Libre and Open Source Software &quot; -- which , besides being redundant terms , seek to spread the ideology that software should not be seen as a political issue .
As all these are synonyms and in the interest of clarity , this paper is using the original term , Free Software .
The Free Software groups became truly involved in the WSIS during the Intersessional Meeting in Paris in July 2003 .
At this point , the proprietary software advocates had almost succeeded in eliminating the political issues around software from the documents by portraying them as a purely technical choice of software development .
Within Civil Society , software issues were part of the Patents , Copyrights and Trademarks ( PCT ) Working Group , which centrally dealt with all issues around intellectual poverty as well as equal and inclusive access to software , the digital cultural technique .
In a concerted effort between the PCT working group and a handful of governments , most notably Brazil , it was possible to put an end to further erosion of software issues from the documents and revert the trend .
This positive trend continued in the following Preparatory Committee Conferences , during which Free Software and Patents , Copyrights and Trademarks ( PCT ) were among the most controversial issues .
&quot; Software is the medium of and structuring entity for the digital domain .
The information age will rest upon it .
Having been denounced as a technical development model , Free Software is much more than that .
It is a paradigm that secures equal chances and freedom for governments , economy and civil society alike .
It provides a truly sustainable model for all areas of society , bringing back competition and furthering innovation for a prosperous and inclusive information and knowledge society for all .
&quot; Software is the cultural technique of the digital age and access to it determines who may participate in a digital world .
Free Software with its freedoms of use for any purpose , studying , modification and redistribution is an essential building block for an empowering , sustainable and inclusive information society .
No software model should be forbidden or negatively regulated , but Free Software should be promoted for its unique social , educational , scientific , political and economic benefits and opportunities .
Despite the massive presence of proprietary software support from both industry and several governments , in particular the United States and several European Union states , such as the UK , this made it impossible to deny the political consequences and impact of software .
Free Software gained much political visibility during WSIS , but while Civil Society has adopted it widely as a principle , many organisations still use proprietary software themselves .
The effect of this practice on developing countries has never been subject of deep research , but seeral consequences are to be expected .
The psychological damage of organisations telling others to follow policies that they ignore themselves can be considerable .
Especially in Southern countries , this can easily create the impression of a policy trying to satisfy people with breadcrumbs while keeping the more valuable things to themselves .
That would be tragic , as the opposite is indeed true .
More severely , by showing to use proprietary software themselves or even advocating use of proprietary software in Southern countries , organisations can involuntarily destroy the effect of their work .
While trying to rid Southern countries from dependency on the North and strengthening democracy , they do the opposite .
To gain a seeming short ##AT##-##AT## term improvement of the situation , they create strong mid ##AT##-##AT## term dependencies for participation in the Information Society .
That is why Sergio Amadeu da Silveira , president of the National Information Technology Institute ( ITI ) in Brasil likened the proprietary software model to that of drug dealers -- the first shot is gratis .
So while much progress has been made , there is still need for further development on all sides : Governments , Industry and Civil Society .
As is already inherent in the Declaration of Principles and the Plan of Action , all sides will need to develop a practice of evaluating the political , social and economic side of software along with its technological capabilities .
To uphold their political independence and democratic basis , Governments will need to make deliberate efforts to further economic and social empowerment based on commercial and non ##AT##-##AT## commercial Free Software .
To protect their commercial interests , Industry based on and active in Free Software will need to provide a counterweight to proprietary software voices .
And to maintain its credibility , Civil Society will need to consistently use Free Software as well as advocate it .

The upgrade scenarios from an existing WB version to a newer one is explained in more detail here .
Question : Can HTML , Javascript und PHP statements be mixed ?
However , Javascript and PHP statements will only be parsed when invoked from a pages or sections of type : Code .
It is not possible to put working PHP or Javascript statements to a WYSIWYG page or section ( you can add it , but the statements will not be executed ! ! !
You have to use the echo or print commands of PHP , when using Javascript and HTML statements within a page or section of type code ( page type code is made for parsing PHP ) .
You need to escape all special characters by yourself .
Best way of mixing HTML code with Javascript statements is to use the PHP Heredoc Syntax ( consult the PHP manual for details ) .
Copy the following code into a page / section of type code and view the results .
Question : Mails sent via the Form module do not show up - why ?
If you have specified a valid recipient address but emails do not show up , please read this Knowledge base article .
Question : What is the WB IRC chat ?
IRC ( Internet Relay Chat ) is a form of real ##AT##-##AT## time Internet chat or synchronous conferencing .
It is mainly designed for group ( many ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## many ) communication in discussion forums called channels , but also allows one ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## one communication and data transfers via private message .
Website Baker has a permanent channel at freenode.net , thanks to tomhung !
You first must have an IRC Client .
If you use Opera , you already have a built ##AT##-##AT## in client , for Firefox there &apos;s the Add ##AT##-##AT## on ChatZilla .
If you don &apos;t like them or use another browser you could either use the &quot; all ##AT##-##AT## in ##AT##-##AT## one &quot; instant message clients Miranda IM or Trilian , or pure IRC clients like X ##AT##-##AT## chat or the ( not free but &quot; everybody has &quot; ) mIRC .
Look at wikipedia - there are many comparison sheets if you are unsure which of them fits your needs .
Well - why do I have to get there ?
You can easily chat with other WB users , get in contact with the developers , and the Website Baker teams also have meetings there .
But don &apos;t expect hundreds of skilled WB users waiting to solve your problems - the chat is only an additional part for making organisation and user contacts more efficient .
Please don &apos;t think &quot; Oh , there &apos;s another user , perhaps he can solve all my problems &quot; and then posting questions like &quot; WB isn &apos;t working - I give you admin rights , could you get it going ?
&quot; or &quot; I saw somewhere a nice template , please do it now for me , I need it tomorrow and if I don &apos;t get it I will cry all day .
&quot; Website Baker is OpenSource- nobody here on websitebaker.org and in the chat gets any money for helping other WB users and many people put a big amount of time in that .

The board 7317 is used to supply substations or individual radio controlled clock boards with a DCF77 ##AT##-##AT## antenna signal .
On the 7001 data bus there is a simulated DCF77 ##AT##-##AT## pulse as well as a square frequency of 77.5 kHz .
The board creates a DCF77 ##AT##-##AT## antenna signal from this information and leads it to 4 potential free output amplifiers .
In case of a failure of the original DCF77 ##AT##-##AT## signal , the output of the simulated signal is kept up .
Therefore all connected radio controlled clocks or systems do not drift apart but run synchronously .

We &apos;re going mobile mad this June at Casino Tropez and sharing our love of mobile gambling with you .
We &apos;ll give you the lowdown on how to start playing through your mobile phone , along with some fun mobile trivia and details on our special Mobile Day promotion .
FAQ : How do I know if my mobile phone is compatible with Casino Tropez Mobile ?
One of the most popular games to play through your mobile handset is the old classic favourite - Blackjack .
Simply get a card total closer to 21 than the dealer &apos;s cards , without exceeding 21 to win .
In Blackjack , aces count as either 1 or 11 , face cards as 10 , and number cards at their face value .
If you receive an ace and a ten ##AT##-##AT## value card as your first two cards , you have Blackjack and have already won !
When the total value of your cards is closer to 21 than the dealer &apos;s , you also win , but if the total of your cards is more than 21 , you &apos;re &quot; bust &quot; and lose your bet .
If you and the dealer have the same card total ( 17 and up ) both of you lose and your bet is returned to you .
Blackjack ( specifically an ace and a jack of spades or clubs ) beats a regular score of 21 .
It &apos;s similar to spending cash in the real world : It requires no registration , and the player &apos;s financial information is completely secure .
You can purchase Ukash in local stores ( at PayPoint locations nationwide ) , using real money and can spend Ukash wherever the Ukash logo is displayed .
In addition to the monetary value Ukash vouchers also display a unique 19 ##AT##-##AT## digit number which is valid for six months from the purchase .
Simply purchase your Ukash voucher at any of the participating retail outlets and enter the Voucher 19 ##AT##-##AT## digit number in the casino cashier .
The maximum for an individual Ukash transaction is £ 100 / € 150 .
You can purchase up to 5 vouchers at one time .

1 Now the Lord God caused the a famine to wax sore in the land of Ur , insomuch that b Haran , my brother , died ; but c Terah , my father , yet lived in the land of Ur , of the Chaldees .
2 And it came to pass that I , Abraham , took a Sarai to wife , and b Nahor , my brother , took Milcah to wife , who was the c daughter of Haran .
3 Now the Lord had a said unto me : Abraham , get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and from thy father ’ s house , unto a land that I will show thee .
4 Therefore I left the land of a Ur , of the Chaldees , to go into the land of Canaan ; and I took Lot , my brother ’ s son , and his wife , and Sarai my wife ; and also my b father followed after me , unto the land which we denominated Haran .
5 And the famine abated ; and my father tarried in Haran and dwelt there , as there were many flocks in Haran ; and my father turned again unto his a idolatry , therefore he continued in Haran .
6 But I , Abraham , and Lot , my brother ’ s son , prayed unto the Lord , and the Lord a appeared unto me , and said unto me : Arise , and take Lot with thee ; for I have purposed to take thee away out of Haran , and to make of thee a b minister to bear my c name in a strange d land which I will give unto thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession , when they hearken to my voice .
7 For I am the Lord thy God ; I dwell in a heaven ; the earth is my b footstool ; I stretch my hand over the sea , and it obeys my voice ; I cause the wind and the fire to be my c chariot ; I say to the mountains — Depart hence — and behold , they are taken away by a whirlwind , in an instant , suddenly .
8 My a name is Jehovah , and I b know the end from the beginning ; therefore my hand shall be over thee .
13 Thou didst send thine angel to a deliver me from the gods of Elkenah , and I will do well to hearken unto thy voice , therefore let thy servant rise up and depart in peace .
14 So I , Abraham , departed as the Lord had said unto me , and Lot with me ; and I , Abraham , was a sixty and two years old when I departed out of Haran .
16 Therefore , a eternity was our covering and our b rock and our salvation , as we journeyed from Haran by the way of c Jershon , to come to the land of Canaan .
17 Now I , Abraham , built an a altar in the land of Jershon , and made an offering unto the Lord , and prayed that the b famine might be turned away from my father ’ s house , that they might not perish .
18 And then we passed from Jershon through the land unto the place of Sechem ; it was situated in the plains of Moreh , and we had already come into the borders of the land of the a Canaanites , and I offered b sacrifice there in the plains of Moreh , and called on the Lord devoutly , because we had already come into the land of this idolatrous nation .
19 And the Lord a appeared unto me in answer to my prayers , and said unto me : Unto thy seed will I give this b land .
20 And I , Abraham , arose from the place of the altar which I had built unto the Lord , and removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of a Bethel , and pitched my tent there , Bethel on the west , and b Hai on the east ; and there I built another c altar unto the Lord , and d called again upon the name of the Lord .
21 And I , Abraham , journeyed , going on still towards the south ; and there was a continuation of a famine in the land ; and I , Abraham , concluded to go down into Egypt , to sojourn there , for the famine became very grievous .
24 Let her say unto the Egyptians , she is thy sister , and thy soul shall live .
25 And it came to pass that I , Abraham , told Sarai , my wife , all that the Lord had said unto me — Therefore say unto them , I pray thee , thou art my a sister , that it may be well with me for thy sake , and my soul shall live because of thee .
Visions manifested to Joseph Smith the Prophet and Oliver Cowdery in the temple at Kirtland , Ohio , April 3 , 1836 . HC 2 : 435 – 436 .
The Prophet prefaces his record of the manifestations with these words : “ In the afternoon , I assisted the other Presidents in distributing the Lord ’ s Supper to the Church , receiving it from the Twelve , whose privilege it was to officiate at the sacred desk this day .
After having performed this service to my brethren , I retired to the pulpit , the veils being dropped , and bowed myself , with Oliver Cowdery , in solemn and silent prayer .
1 – 10 , The Lord Jehovah appears in glory and accepts the Kirtland Temple as his house ; 11 – 12 , Moses and Elias each appear and commit their keys and dispensations ; 13 – 16 , Elijah returns and commits the keys of his dispensation as promised by Malachi .
1 The a veil was taken from our minds , and the b eyes of our c understanding were opened .
2 We a saw the Lord b standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit , before us ; and under his feet was a paved work of pure c gold , in color like amber .
4 I am the a first and the last ; I am he who b liveth , I am he who was slain ; I am your c advocate with the Father .
5 Behold , your sins are a forgiven you ; you are clean before me ; therefore , lift up your heads and b rejoice .
6 Let the hearts of your brethren rejoice , and let the hearts of all my people rejoice , who have , with their might , a built this house to my name .
7 For behold , I have a accepted this b house , and my name shall be here ; and I will c manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house .
8 Yea , I will a appear unto my servants , and speak unto them with mine own voice , if my people will keep my commandments , and do not b pollute this c holy house .
9 Yea the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice in consequence of the a blessings which shall be poured out , and the b endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house .
10 And the fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands ; and this is the beginning of the blessing which shall be a poured out upon the heads of my people .
11 After this a vision closed , the heavens were again b opened unto us ; and c Moses appeared before us , and committed unto us the d keys of the e gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth , and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the f north .
12 After this , a Elias appeared , and committed the b dispensation of the c gospel of Abraham , saying that in us and our seed all d generations after us should be e blessed .
16 Therefore , the a keys of this b dispensation are committed into your hands ; and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful c day of the Lord is near , even at the doors .
Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet , at Nauvoo , Illinois , January 19 , 1841 . HC 4 : 274 – 286 .
Because of increasing persecutions and illegal procedures against them by public officers , the saints had been compelled to leave Missouri .
The exterminating order issued by Lilburn W. Boggs , Governor of Missouri , dated October 27 , 1838 , had left them no alternative . See HC 3 : 175 .
In 1841 , when this revelation was given , the city of Nauvoo , occupying the site of the former village of Commerce , Illinois , had been built up by the saints , and here the headquarters of the Church had been established .
1 Verily , thus saith the Lord unto you , my servant Joseph Smith , I am well pleased with your a offering and acknowledgments , which you have made ; for unto this end have I raised you up , that I might show forth my b wisdom through the c weak things of the earth .
2 Your prayers are acceptable before me ; and in answer to them I say unto you , that you are now called immediately to make a solemn a proclamation of my gospel , and of this b stake which I have planted to be a c cornerstone of Zion , which shall be polished with the refinement which is after the similitude of a palace .
3 This proclamation shall be made to all the a kings of the world , to the four corners thereof , to the honorable president ##AT##-##AT## elect , and the high ##AT##-##AT## minded governors of the nation in which you live , and to all the nations of the earth scattered abroad .
5 For it shall be a given you by the Holy Ghost to know my b will concerning those c kings and authorities , even what shall befall them in a time to come .
6 For , behold , I am about to call upon them to give heed to the light and glory of Zion , for the set time has come to favor her .
8 And that I may a visit them in the day of visitation , when I shall b unveil the face of my covering , to appoint the portion of the c oppressor among hypocrites , where there is d gnashing of teeth , if they reject my servants and my testimony which I have revealed unto them .
9 And again , I will visit and soften their hearts , many of them for your good , that ye may find grace in their eyes , that they may come to the a light of truth , and the Gentiles to the exaltation or lifting up of Zion .
10 For the day of my visitation cometh speedily , in an a hour when ye think not of ; and where shall be the safety of my people , and refuge for those who shall be left of them ?
11 Awake , O kings of the earth !
Come ye , O , come ye , with your a gold and your silver , to the help of my people , to the house of the daughters of Zion .
14 But let him remember that his a stewardship will I require at his hands .
15 And again , verily I say unto you , blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith ; for I , the Lord , love him because of the a integrity of his heart , and because he loveth that which is right before me , saith the Lord .
16 Again , let my servant John C. Bennett help you in your labor in sending my word to the kings and people of the earth , and stand by you , even you my servant Joseph Smith , in the hour of affliction ; and his reward shall not fail if he receive a counsel .
17 And for his love he shall be great , for he shall be mine if he do this , saith the Lord .
I have seen the work which he hath done , which I accept if he continue , and will crown him with blessings and great glory .
18 And again , I say unto you that it is my will that my servant Lyman Wight should continue in preaching for Zion , in the spirit of meekness , confessing me before the world ; and I will bear him up as on a eagles ’ wings ; and he shall beget glory and honor to himself and unto my name .
19 That when he shall finish his work I may a receive him unto myself , even as I did my servant David Patten , who is with me at this time , and also my servant b Edward Partridge , and also my aged servant Joseph Smith , Sen. , who sitteth c with Abraham at his right hand , and blessed and holy is he , for he is mine .
20 And again , verily I say unto you , my servant George Miller is without a guile ; he may be trusted because of the b integrity of his heart ; and for the love which he has to my testimony I , the Lord , love him .
21 I therefore say unto you , I seal upon his head the office of a bishopric , like unto my a servant Edward Partridge , that he may receive the consecrations of mine house , that he may administer blessings upon the heads of the poor of my people , saith the Lord .
Let no man despise my servant George , for he shall honor me .
22 Let my servant George , and my servant Lyman , and my servant John Snider , and others , build a a house unto my name , such a one as my servant Joseph shall show unto them , upon the place which he shall show unto them also .
23 And it shall be for a house for boarding , a house that strangers may come from afar to lodge therein ; therefore let it be a good house , worthy of all acceptation , that the weary a traveler may find health and safety while he shall contemplate the word of the Lord ; and the b corner ##AT##-##AT## stone I have appointed for Zion .
24 This house shall be a healthful habitation if it be built unto my name , and if the governor which shall be appointed unto it shall not suffer any pollution to come upon it .
It shall be holy , or the Lord your God will not a dwell therein .
25 And again , verily I say unto you , let all my saints a come from afar .
27 And with iron , with copper , and with brass , and with zinc , and with all your precious things of the earth ; and build a a house to my name , for the Most High to b dwell therein .
28 For there is not a place found on earth that he may come to and a restore again that which was lost unto you , or which he hath taken away , even the fulness of the priesthood .
30 For this ordinance belongeth to my house , and cannot be acceptable to me , only in the days of your poverty , wherein ye are not able to build a house unto me .
31 But I command you , all ye my saints , to a build a house unto me ; and I grant unto you a sufficient time to build a house unto me ; and during this time your baptisms shall be acceptable unto me .
32 But behold , at the end of this appointment your baptisms for your dead shall not be acceptable unto me ; and if you do not these things at the end of the appointment ye shall be rejected as a church , with your dead , saith the Lord your God .
34 For therein are the a keys of the holy priesthood ordained , that you may receive honor and glory .
35 And after this time , your baptisms for the dead , by those who are scattered abroad , are not acceptable unto me , saith the Lord .
36 For it is ordained that in Zion , and in her stakes , and in Jerusalem , those places which I have appointed for a refuge , shall be the places for your baptisms for your dead .
37 And again , verily I say unto you , how shall your a washings be acceptable unto me , except ye perform them in a house which you have built to my name ?
38 For , for this cause I commanded Moses that he should build a a tabernacle , that they should bear it with them in the wilderness , and to build a house in the land of promise , that those ordinances might be revealed which had been hid from before the world was .
41 For I deign to a reveal unto my church things which have been kept b hid from before the foundation of the world , things that pertain to the dispensation of the c fulness of times .
42 And a I will show unto my servant Joseph all things pertaining to this house , and the priesthood thereof , and the place whereon it shall be built .
43 And ye shall build it on the place where you have contemplated building it , for that is the spot which I have chosen for you to build it .
44 If ye labor with all your might , I will consecrate that spot that it shall be made a holy .
45 And if my people will hearken unto my voice , and unto the voice of my a servants whom I have appointed to lead my people , behold , verily I say unto you , they shall not be moved out of their place .
46 But if they will not a hearken to my voice , nor unto the voice of these men whom I have appointed , they shall not be blest , because they b pollute mine holy grounds , and mine holy ordinances , and charters , and my holy words which I give unto them .
47 And it shall come to pass that if you build a house unto my name , and do not do the things that I say , I will not perform the a oath which I make unto you , neither fulfil the promises which ye expect at my hands , saith the Lord .
48 For a instead of blessings , ye , by your own works , bring cursings , wrath , indignation , and judgments upon your own heads , by your follies , and by all your abominations , which you practise before me , saith the Lord .
50 And the iniquity and transgression of my holy laws and commandments I will a visit upon the heads of those who hindered my work , unto the third and fourth b generation , so long as they repent not , and hate me , saith the Lord God .
51 Therefore , for this cause have I accepted the offerings of those whom I commanded to build up a city and a a house unto my name , in Jackson county , Missouri , and were hindered by their enemies , saith the Lord your God .
52 And I will answer a judgment , wrath , and indignation , wailing , and anguish , and gnashing of teeth upon their heads , unto the third and fourth generation , so long as they repent not , and hate me , saith the Lord your God .
53 And this I make an a example unto you , for your consolation concerning all those who have been commanded to do a work and have been hindered by the hands of their enemies , and by b oppression , saith the Lord your God .
54 For I am the Lord your God , and will save all those of your brethren who have been a pure in heart , and have been b slain in the land of Missouri , saith the Lord .
55 And again , verily I say unto you , I command you again to build a a house to my name , even in this place , that you may b prove yourselves unto me that ye are c faithful in all things whatsoever I command you , that I may bless you , and crown you with honor , immortality , and eternal life .
56 And now I say unto you , as pertaining to my boarding a house which I have commanded you to build for the boarding of strangers , let it be built unto my name , and let my name be named upon it , and let my servant Joseph and his house have place therein , from generation to generation .
57 For this a anointing have I put upon his head , that his blessing shall also be put upon the head of his posterity after him .
58 And as I said unto a Abraham concerning the kindreds of the earth , even so I say unto my servant Joseph : In thee and in thy b seed shall the kindred of the earth be blessed .
59 Therefore , let my servant Joseph and his seed after him have place in that house , from generation to generation , forever and ever , saith the Lord .
61 That he may receive also the counsel from those whom I have set to be as a plants of renown , and as b watchmen upon her walls .
62 Behold , verily I say unto you , let my servant George Miller , and my servant Lyman Wight , and my servant John Snider , and my servant Peter Haws , organize themselves , and appoint one of them to be a president over their quorum for the purpose of building that house .
63 And they shall form a constitution , whereby they may receive stock for the building of that house .
64 And they shall not receive less than fifty dollars for a share of stock in that house , and they shall be permitted to receive fifteen thousand dollars from any one man for stock in that house .
65 But they shall not be permitted to receive over fifteen thousand dollars stock from any one man .
66 And they shall not be permitted to receive under fifty dollars for a share of stock from any one man in that house .
68 And in proportion to the amount of stock he pays into their hands he shall receive stock in that house ; but if he pays nothing into their hands he shall not receive any stock in that house .
69 And if any pay stock into their hands it shall be for stock in that house , for himself , and for his generation after him , from generation to generation , so long as he and his heirs shall hold that stock , and do not sell or convey the stock away out of their hands by their own free will and act , if you will do my will , saith the Lord your God .
70 And again , verily I say unto you , if my servant George Miller , and my servant Lyman Wight , and my servant John Snider , and my servant Peter Haws , receive any stock into their hands , in moneys , or in properties wherein they receive the real value of moneys , they shall not appropriate any portion of that stock to any other purpose , only in that house .
71 And if they do appropriate any portion of that stock anywhere else , only in that house , without the consent of the stockholder , and do not repay fourfold for the stock which they appropriate anywhere else , only in that house , they shall be accursed , and shall be moved out of their place , saith the Lord God ; for I , the Lord , am God , and cannot be a mocked in any of these things .
72 Verily I say unto you , let my servant Joseph pay stock into their hands for the building of that house , as seemeth him good ; but my servant Joseph cannot pay over fifteen thousand dollars stock in that house , nor under fifty dollars ; neither can any other man , saith the Lord .
73 And there are others also who wish to know my will concerning them , for they have asked it at my hands .
74 Therefore , I say unto you concerning my servant Vinson Knight , if he will do my will let him put stock into that house for himself , and for his generation after him , from generation to generation .
75 And let him lift up his voice long and loud , in the midst of the people , to a plead the cause of the poor and the needy ; and let him not fail , neither let his heart faint ; and I will b accept of his offerings , for they shall not be unto me as the offerings of Cain , for he shall be mine , saith the Lord .
76 Let his family rejoice and turn away their hearts from affliction ; for I have chosen him and anointed him , and he shall be honored in the midst of his house , for I will forgive all his sins , saith the Lord .
77 Verily I say unto you , let my servant Hyrum put stock into that house as seemeth him good , for himself and his generation after him , from generation to generation .
78 Let my servant Isaac Galland put stock into that house ; for I , the Lord , love him for the work he hath done , and will forgive all his sins ; therefore , let him be remembered for an interest in that house from generation to generation .
79 Let my servant Isaac Galland be appointed among you , and be ordained by my servant William Marks , and be blessed of him , to go with my servant Hyrum to accomplish the work that my servant Joseph shall point out to them , and they shall be greatly blessed .
80 Let my servant William Marks pay stock into that house , as seemeth him good , for himself and his generation , from generation to generation .
81 Let my servant Henry G. Sherwood pay stock into that house , as seemeth him good , for himself and his seed after him , from generation to generation .
82 Let my servant William Law pay stock into that house , for himself and his seed after him , from generation to generation .
83 If he will do my will let him not take his family unto the eastern lands , even unto Kirtland ; nevertheless , I , the Lord , will build up a Kirtland , but I , the Lord , have a scourge prepared for the inhabitants thereof .
84 And with my servant Almon Babbitt , there are many things with which I am not pleased ; behold , he aspireth to establish his counsel instead of the counsel which I have ordained , even that of the Presidency of my Church ; and he setteth up a a golden calf for the worship of my people .
85 Let no man a go from this place who has come here essaying to keep my commandments .
86 If they live here let them live unto me ; and if they die let them die unto me ; for they shall a rest from all their labors here , and shall continue their works .
87 Therefore , let my servant William put his trust in me , and cease to fear concerning his family , because of the sickness of the land .
If ye a love me , keep my commandments ; and the sickness of the land shall b redound to your glory .
88 Let my servant William go and proclaim my everlasting gospel with a loud voice , and with great joy , as he shall be moved upon by my a Spirit , unto the inhabitants of Warsaw , and also unto the inhabitants of Carthage , and also unto the inhabitants of Burlington , and also unto the inhabitants of Madison , and await patiently and diligently for further instructions at my general conference , saith the Lord .
89 If he will do my a will let him from henceforth hearken to the counsel of my servant Joseph , and with his interest support the b cause of the poor , and publish c the new translation of my holy word unto the inhabitants of the earth .
90 And if he will do this I will a bless him with a multiplicity of blessings , that he shall not be forsaken , nor his seed be found b begging bread .
93 That whoever he blesses shall be blessed , and whoever he a curses shall be cursed ; that whatsoever he shall b bind on earth shall be bound in heaven ; and whatsoever he shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
96 That my servant Hyrum may bear record of the things which I shall show unto him , that his name may be had in honorable remembrance from generation to generation , forever and ever .
97 Let my servant William Law also receive the keys by which he may ask and receive blessings ; let him be a humble before me , and be without b guile , and he shall receive of my Spirit , even the c Comforter , which shall manifest unto him the truth of all things , and shall give him , in the very hour , what he shall say .
99 And he shall be led in paths where the poisonous serpent a cannot lay hold upon his heel , and he shall mount up in the b imagination of his thoughts as upon eagles ’ wings .
100 And what if I will that he should a raise the dead , let him not withhold his voice .
101 Therefore , let my servant William cry aloud and spare not , with joy and rejoicing , and with hosannas to him that sitteth upon the throne forever and ever , saith the Lord your God .
102 Behold , I say unto you , I have a mission in store for my servant William , and my servant Hyrum , and for them alone ; and let my servant Joseph tarry at home , for he is needed .
The remainder I will show unto you hereafter .
103 And again , verily I say unto you , if my servant Sidney will serve me and be a counselor unto my servant Joseph , let him arise and come up and stand in the office of his calling , and humble himself before me .
104 And if he will offer unto me an acceptable offering , and acknowledgments , and remain with my people , behold , I , the Lord your God , will heal him that he shall be healed ; and he shall lift up his voice again on the mountains , and be a a spokesman before my face .
105 Let him come and locate his family in the neighborhood in which my servant Joseph resides .
106 And in all his journeyings let him lift up his voice as with the sound of a trump , and warn the inhabitants of the earth to flee the wrath to come .
107 Let him assist my servant Joseph , and also let my servant William Law assist my servant Joseph , in making a solemn a proclamation unto the kings of the earth , even as I have before said unto you .
108 If my servant Sidney will do my will , let him not remove his family unto the a eastern lands , but let him change their habitation , even as I have said .
109 Behold , it is not my will that he shall seek to find safety and refuge out of the city which I have appointed unto you , even the city of Nauvoo .
110 Verily I say unto you , even now , if he will hearken unto my voice , it shall be well with him .
111 And again , verily I say unto you , let my servant Amos Davies pay stock into the hands of those whom I have appointed to build a house for boarding , even the Nauvoo House .
112 This let him do if he will have an interest ; and let him hearken unto the counsel of my servant Joseph , and labor with his own hands that he may obtain the confidence of men .
114 Let him therefore a abase himself that he may be exalted .
115 And again , verily I say unto you , if my servant Robert D. Foster will obey my voice , let him build a house for my servant Joseph , according to the contract which he has made with him , as the door shall be open to him from time to time .
118 And hearken unto the counsel of my servants Joseph , and Hyrum , and William Law , and unto the authorities which I have called to lay the foundation of Zion ; and it shall be well with him forever and ever .
120 For that which is a more or less than this cometh of evil , and shall be attended with cursings and not blessings , saith the Lord your God .
121 And again , verily I say unto you , let the quorum of the Nauvoo House have a just recompense of wages for all their labors which they do in building the Nauvoo House ; and let their wages be as shall be agreed among themselves , as pertaining to the price thereof .
122 And let every man who pays stock bear his proportion of their wages , if it must needs be , for their support , saith the Lord ; otherwise , their labors shall be accounted unto them for stock in that house .
123 Verily I say unto you , I now give unto you the a officers belonging to my Priesthood , that ye may hold the b keys thereof , even the Priesthood which is after the order of Melchizedek , which is after the order of mine c Only Begotten Son .
124 First , I give unto you Hyrum Smith to be a a patriarch unto you , to hold the b sealing blessings of my church , even the Holy Spirit of c promise , whereby ye are d sealed up unto the day of redemption , that ye may not fall notwithstanding the e hour of temptation that may come upon you .
125 I give unto you my servant Joseph to be a presiding elder over all my church , to be a translator , a revelator , a a seer , and prophet .
126 I give unto him for a counselors my servant Sidney Rigdon and my servant William Law , that these may constitute a quorum and First Presidency , to receive the b oracles for the whole church .
128 Which a Twelve hold the keys to open up the authority of my kingdom upon the four corners of the earth , and after that to send my word to every b creature .
130 David Patten I have a taken unto myself ; behold , his b priesthood no man c taketh from him ; but , verily I say unto you , another may be appointed unto the same calling .
132 Namely , Samuel Bent , Henry G. Sherwood , George W. Harris , Charles C. Rich , Thomas Grover , Newel Knight , David Dort , Dunbar Wilson — Seymour Brunson I have taken unto myself ; no man taketh his priesthood , but another may be appointed unto the same priesthood in his stead ; and verily I say unto you , let my servant Aaron Johnson be ordained unto this calling in his stead — David Fullmer , Alpheus Cutler , William Huntington .
135 And they may travel also if they choose , but rather be ordained for standing presidents ; this is the office of their calling , saith the Lord your God .
136 I give unto him Amasa Lyman and Noah Packard for counselors , that they may preside over the quorum of high priests of my church , saith the Lord .
137 And again , I say unto you , I give unto you John A. Hicks , Samuel Williams , and Jesse Baker , which priesthood is to preside over the quorum of a elders , which quorum is instituted for standing ministers ; nevertheless they may travel , yet they are ordained to be standing ministers to my church , saith the Lord .
139 Which quorum is instituted for a traveling elders to bear record of my name in all the world , wherever the traveling high council , mine apostles , shall send them to prepare a way before my face .
140 The difference between this quorum and the quorum of elders is that one is to travel continually , and the other is to preside over the churches from time to time ; the one has the responsibility of presiding from time to time , and the other has no responsibility of presiding , saith the Lord your God .
141 And again , I say unto you , I give unto you Vinson Knight , Samuel H. Smith , and Shadrach Roundy , if he will receive it , to preside over the a bishopric ; a knowledge of said bishopric is given unto you in the book of Doctrine and Covenants .
142 And again , I say unto you , Samuel Rolfe and his counselors for a priests , and the president of the teachers and his counselors , and also the president of the deacons and his counselors , and also the president of the stake and his counselors .
143 The above a offices I have given unto you , and the keys thereof , for helps and for governments , for the work of the ministry and the b perfecting of my saints .
145 And that ye should prepare rooms for all these offices in my a house when you build it unto my name , saith the Lord your God .
Instructions by Joseph Smith the Prophet , given at Ramus , Illinois , May 16 and 17 , 1843 . HC 5 : 392 – 393 .
1 – 4 , Celestial marriage is essential to exaltation in the highest heaven ; 5 – 6 , How men are sealed up unto eternal life ; 7 – 8 , All spirit is matter .
3 And if he does not , he cannot obtain it .
4 He may enter into the other , but that is the end of his kingdom ; he cannot have an a increase .
5 ( May 17th , 1843 . ) The more sure word of a prophecy means a man ’ s knowing that he is b sealed up unto c eternal life , by revelation and the spirit of prophecy , through the power of the Holy Priesthood .
6 It is impossible for a man to be a saved in b ignorance .
7 There is no such thing as immaterial matter .
8 We cannot a see it ; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all b matter .
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , in the presence of six elders , at Fayette , New York , September 1830 . HC 1 : 111 – 115 .
This revelation was given some days prior to the conference beginning September 26 , 1830 .
2 Who will a gather his people even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , even as many as will hearken to my voice and b humble themselves before me , and call upon me in mighty prayer .
3 Behold , verily , verily , I say unto you , that at this time your a sins are b forgiven you , therefore ye receive these things ; but remember to sin no more , lest perils shall come upon you .
4 Verily , I say unto you that ye are chosen out of the world to declare my gospel with the sound of rejoicing , as with the a voice of a trump .
5 Lift up your hearts and be a glad , for I am in your b midst , and am your c advocate with the Father ; and it is his good will to give you the d kingdom .
6 And , as it is written — Whatsoever ye shall a ask in b faith , being c united in prayer according to my command , ye shall receive .
8 Wherefore the decree hath gone forth from the Father that they shall be a gathered in unto one place upon the face of this land , to b prepare their hearts and be prepared in all things against the day when c tribulation and desolation are sent forth upon the wicked .
11 For I will reveal a myself from heaven with power and great glory , with all the b hosts thereof , and c dwell in d righteousness with men on earth a e thousand years , and the wicked shall not stand .
13 For a a trump shall sound both long and loud , even as upon Mount Sinai , and all the b earth shall quake , and they shall c come forth — yea , even the d dead which died in me , to receive a e crown of righteousness , and to be clothed upon , f even as I am , to be with me , that we may be one .
16 And there shall be a great a hailstorm sent forth to destroy the b crops of the earth .
17 And it shall come to pass , because of the wickedness of the world , that I will take a vengeance upon the b wicked , for they will not repent ; for the c cup of mine d indignation is full ; for behold , my e blood shall not f cleanse them if they hear me not .
20 And it shall come to pass that the a beasts of the forest and the fowls of the air shall devour them up .
21 And the great and a abominable church , which is the b whore of all the earth , shall be cast down by c devouring fire , according as it is spoken by the mouth of Ezekiel the prophet , who spoke of these things , which have not come to pass but surely d must , as I live , for e abominations shall not reign .
23 And the a end shall come , and the heaven and the earth shall be consumed and b pass away , and there shall be a new heaven and a c new earth .
25 And not one a hair , neither mote , shall be lost , for it is the b workmanship of mine hand .
26 But , behold , verily I say unto you , before the earth shall pass away , a Michael , mine archangel , shall sound his b trump , and then shall all the dead c awake , for their graves shall be opened , and they shall d come forth — yea , even all .
28 Wherefore I will say unto them — a Depart from me , ye cursed , into everlasting b fire , prepared for the c devil and his angels .
29 And now , behold , I say unto you , never at any time have I declared from mine own mouth that they should return , for a where I am they cannot come , for they have no power .
30 But remember that all my judgments are not given unto men ; and as the words have gone forth out of my mouth even so shall they be fulfilled , that the a first shall be last , and that the last shall be first in all things whatsoever I have created by the word of my power , which is the power of my b Spirit .
33 a Speaking unto you that you may naturally understand ; but unto myself my works have no b end , neither beginning ; but it is given unto you that ye may understand , because ye have asked it of me and are agreed .
34 Wherefore , verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual , and not at any time have I given unto you a a law which was b temporal ; neither any man , nor the children of men ; neither Adam , your father , whom I created .
35 Behold , I gave unto him that he should be an a agent unto himself ; and I gave unto him commandment , but no temporal commandment gave I unto him , for my b commandments are c spiritual ; they are not natural nor temporal , neither carnal nor sensual .
38 And , behold , there is a place a prepared for them from the beginning , which place is b hell .
40 Wherefore , it came to pass that the devil tempted Adam , and he partook of the forbidden a fruit and b transgressed the commandment , wherein he became c subject to the will of the devil , because he yielded unto temptation .
41 Wherefore , I , the Lord God , caused that he should be a cast out from the Garden of b Eden , from my presence , because of his transgression , wherein he became c spiritually d dead , which is the first death , even that same death which is the last e death , which is spiritual , which shall be pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say : Depart , ye f cursed .
42 But , behold , I say unto you that I , the Lord God , gave unto Adam and unto his seed , that they should not a die as to the temporal death , until I , the Lord God , should send forth b angels to declare unto them c repentance and d redemption , through faith on the name of mine e Only Begotten Son .
45 For they love darkness rather than light , and their a deeds are evil , and they receive their b wages of c whom they list to obey .
48 For it is given unto them even as I will , according to mine own a pleasure , that great things may be required at the hand of their b fathers .
49 And , again , I say unto you , that whoso having knowledge , have I not commanded to a repent ?
50 And he that hath no a understanding , it remaineth in me to do according as it is written .
And now I declare no more unto you at this time .
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , in Zion , Jackson County , Missouri , August 7 , 1831 . HC 1 : 196 – 201 .
Preceding his record of this revelation , the Prophet writes descriptively of the land of Zion wherein the people were then assembled .
The land was consecrated , as the Lord had directed , and the site for the future temple was dedicated .
The Lord makes these commandments especially applicable to the saints in Zion .
1 – 4 , The faithful saints in Zion shall be blessed ; 5 – 8 , They are to love and serve the Lord and keep his commandments ; 9 – 19 , By keeping the Lord ’ s day holy , the saints are blessed temporally and spiritually ; 20 – 24 , The righteous are promised peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come .
1 Behold , blessed , saith the Lord , are they who have come up unto this land with an a eye single to my glory , according to my commandments .
2 For those that live shall a inherit the earth , and those that b die shall rest from all their labors , and their works shall follow them ; and they shall receive a c crown in the d mansions of my Father , which I have prepared for them .
3 Yea , blessed are they whose feet stand upon the land of Zion , who have obeyed my gospel ; for they shall receive for their reward the good things of the earth , and it shall bring forth in its a strength .
4 And they shall also be crowned with blessings from above , yea , and with a commandments not a few , and with b revelations in their time — they that are c faithful and d diligent before me .
5 Wherefore , I give unto them a commandment , saying thus : Thou shalt a love the Lord thy God with all thy b heart , with all thy might , mind , and strength ; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt c serve him .
6 Thou shalt a love thy b neighbor as thyself .
Thou shalt not c steal ; neither commit d adultery , nor e kill , nor do anything f like unto it .
7 Thou shalt a thank the Lord thy God in all things .
8 Thou shalt offer a a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in b righteousness , even that of a broken heart and a c contrite spirit .
12 But remember that on this , the a Lord ’ s day , thou shalt offer thine b oblations and thy sacraments unto the Most High , c confessing thy sins unto thy brethren , and before the Lord .
13 And on this day thou shalt do none other thing , only let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart that thy a fasting may be perfect , or , in other words , that thy b joy may be full .
14 Verily , this is fasting and prayer , or in other words , rejoicing and prayer .
19 Yea , for a food and for raiment , for taste and for smell , to b strengthen the body and to enliven the soul .
20 And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man ; for unto this end were they made to be used , with judgment , not to a excess , neither by extortion .
21 And in nothing doth man a offend God , or against none is his b wrath c kindled , save those who d confess not his hand in all things , and e obey not his commandments .
22 Behold , this is according to the law and the prophets ; wherefore , trouble me no more concerning this matter .
23 But learn that he who doeth the works of a righteousness shall receive his b reward , even c peace in this world , and d eternal life in the world to come .
24 I , the Lord , have spoken it , and the Spirit beareth record .
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , at Kirtland , Ohio , September 22 and 23 , 1832 . HC 1 : 286 – 295 .
During the month of September , elders had begun to return from their missions in the eastern states and to make reports of their labors .
It was while they were together in this season of joy that the following communication was received .
The Prophet designates it a revelation on priesthood .
1 A a revelation of Jesus Christ unto his servant Joseph Smith , Jun . , and six elders , as they b united their hearts and c lifted their voices on high .
2 Yea , the word of the Lord concerning his church , established in the last days for the a restoration of his people , as he has spoken by the mouth of his b prophets , and for the c gathering of his d saints to stand upon e Mount Zion , which shall be the city of f New Jerusalem .
3 Which city shall be a built , beginning at the b temple lot , which is appointed by the finger of the Lord , in the western boundaries of the State of Missouri , and c dedicated by the hand of Joseph Smith , Jun . , and others with whom the Lord was well pleased .
4 Verily this is the word of the Lord , that the city a New Jerusalem shall be built by the gathering of the saints , beginning at this place , even the place of the temple , which b temple shall be c reared in this d generation .
5 For verily this generation shall not all a pass away until an b house shall be built unto the Lord , and a c cloud shall rest upon it , which cloud shall be even the d glory of the Lord , which shall fill the house .
12 And Esaias received it under the hand of God .
17 Which a priesthood b continueth in the church of God in all generations , and is without c beginning of days or end of years .
18 And the Lord confirmed a a priesthood also upon b Aaron and his c seed , throughout all their generations , which priesthood also continueth and d abideth forever with the priesthood which is after the holiest order of God .
19 And this greater a priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the b key of the c mysteries of the kingdom , even the key of the d knowledge of God .
20 Therefore , in the a ordinances thereof , the power of b godliness is manifest .
22 For without this no a man can see the face of God , even the Father , and live .
24 But they a hardened their hearts and could not endure his b presence ; therefore , the Lord in his c wrath , for his d anger was kindled against them , swore that they should not e enter into his rest while in the wilderness , which rest is the fulness of his glory .
27 Which a gospel is the gospel of b repentance and of c baptism , and the d remission of sins , and the e law of f carnal commandments , which the Lord in his wrath caused to continue with the house of Aaron among the children of Israel until g John , whom God raised up , being h filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother ’ s womb .
28 For he was baptized while he was yet in his childhood , and was a ordained by the angel of God at the time he was b eight days old unto this power , to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews , and to c make straight the way of the Lord before the face of his people , to prepare them for the d coming of the Lord , in whose hand is given e all power .
29 And again , the a offices of elder and bishop are necessary b appendages belonging unto the high priesthood .
30 And again , the offices of a teacher and deacon are necessary appendages belonging to the lesser priesthood , which priesthood was confirmed upon b Aaron and his sons .
32 And the sons of Moses and of Aaron shall be filled with the a glory of the Lord , upon b Mount Zion in the Lord ’ s house , whose sons are ye ; and also many whom I have called and sent forth to build up my c church .
33 For whoso is a faithful unto the obtaining these two b priesthoods of which I have spoken , and the c magnifying their calling , are d sanctified by the Spirit unto the e renewing of their bodies .
34 They become the a sons of Moses and of Aaron and the b seed of c Abraham , and the church and kingdom , and the d elect of God .
38 And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father ’ s a kingdom ; therefore b all that my Father hath shall be given unto him .
39 And this is according to the a oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood .
40 Therefore , all those who receive the a priesthood , receive this b oath and covenant of my Father , which he cannot break , neither can it be moved .
41 But whoso breaketh this a covenant after he hath received it , and altogether turneth therefrom , shall b not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come .
42 And wo unto all those who come not unto this priesthood which ye have received , which I now confirm upon you who are present this day , by mine own voice out of the heavens ; and even I have given the heavenly hosts and mine angels a charge concerning you .
43 And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves , to give a diligent b heed to the words of eternal life .
44 For you shall a live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God .
45 For the a word of the Lord is truth , and whatsoever is truth is b light , and whatsoever is light is c Spirit , even the Spirit of Jesus Christ .
46 And the a Spirit giveth b light to c every man that cometh into the world ; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world , that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit .
47 And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit a cometh unto God , even the Father .
48 And the Father a teacheth him of the covenant which he has b renewed and confirmed upon you , which is confirmed upon you for your sakes , and not for your sakes only , but for the sake of the c whole world .
49 And the whole a world lieth in sin , and groaneth under b darkness and under the c bondage of sin .
50 And by this you may know they are under the a bondage of sin , because they come not unto me .
51 For whoso cometh not unto me is under the a bondage of sin .
52 And whoso receiveth not my voice is not acquainted with a my voice , and is not of me .
53 And by this you may know the righteous from the wicked , and that the whole a world b groaneth under sin and darkness even now .
55 Which a vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation .
56 And this condemnation resteth upon the children of a Zion , even all .
58 That they may bring forth a fruit meet for their Father ’ s kingdom ; otherwise there remaineth a b scourge and judgment to be poured out upon the children of Zion .
59 For shall the children of the kingdom a pollute my holy land ?
61 For I will a forgive you of your sins with this commandment — that you remain b steadfast in your minds in c solemnity and the spirit of prayer , in bearing d testimony to all the world of those things which are communicated unto you .
62 Therefore , a go ye into all the world ; and unto whatsoever place ye cannot go ye shall send , that the testimony may go from you into all the world unto every creature .
64 Therefore , as I said unto mine apostles I say unto you again , that every a soul who b believeth on your words , and is baptized by water for the c remission of sins , shall d receive the Holy Ghost .
72 And the a poison of a serpent shall not have power to harm them .
73 But a commandment I give unto them , that they shall not a boast themselves of these things , neither speak them before the world ; for these things are given unto you for your profit and for salvation .
74 Verily , verily , I say unto you , they who believe not on your words , and are not a baptized in water in my name , for the b remission of their sins , that they may receive the Holy Ghost , shall be c damned , and shall not come into my Father ’ s kingdom where my Father and I am .
75 And this revelation unto you , and commandment , is in force from this very hour upon all the a world , and the gospel is unto all who have not received it .
76 But , verily I say unto all those to whom the kingdom has been given — from you it a must be b preached unto them , that they shall repent of their former evil works ; for they are to be upbraided for their evil c hearts of unbelief , and your brethren in Zion for their d rebellion against you at the time I sent you .
78 For I suffered them not to have a purse or scrip , neither two coats .
79 Behold , I a send you out to b prove the world , and the laborer is worthy of his c hire .
80 And any man that shall go and preach this a gospel of the kingdom , and fail not to continue b faithful in all things , shall not be weary in mind , neither darkened , neither in body , limb , nor joint ; and a c hair of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed .
And they shall not go hungry , neither athirst .
81 Therefore , take ye no a thought for the morrow , for what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , or wherewithal ye shall be clothed .
82 For , a consider the b lilies of the field , how they grow , they toil not , neither do they spin ; and the kingdoms of the world , in all their glory , are not arrayed like one of these .
83 For your a Father , who is in heaven , b knoweth that you have need of all these things .
84 Therefore , let the morrow take a thought for the things of itself .
85 Neither take ye thought beforehand a what ye shall say ; but b treasure up in your minds continually the words of life , and it shall be c given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man .
86 Therefore , let no man among you , for this commandment is unto all the a faithful who are called of God in the church unto the ministry , from this hour take purse or scrip , that goeth forth to proclaim this gospel of the kingdom .
87 Behold , I send you out to a reprove the world of all their unrighteous deeds , and to teach them of a judgment which is to come .
88 And whoso a receiveth you , there I will be also , for I will go b before your face .
I will be on your right hand and on your left , and my c Spirit shall be in your hearts , and mine d angels round about you , to bear you up .
89 Whoso receiveth you receiveth me ; and the same will feed you , and clothe you , and give you money .
90 And he who feeds you , or clothes you , or gives you money , shall in nowise a lose his reward .
91 And he that doeth not these things is not my disciple ; by this you may know a my disciples .
92 He that receiveth you not , go away from him alone by yourselves , and a cleanse your feet even with water , pure water , whether in heat or in cold , and bear testimony of it unto your Father which is in heaven , and return not again unto that man .
93 And in whatsoever village or city ye enter , do likewise .
94 Nevertheless , search diligently and spare not ; and wo unto that house , or that village or city that rejecteth you , or your words , or your testimony concerning me .
96 For I , the a Almighty , have laid my hands upon the nations , to b scourge them for their c wickedness .
103 And again , verily , verily , I say unto you , it is expedient that every man who goes forth to proclaim mine everlasting gospel , that inasmuch as they have a families , and receive b money by gift , that they should send it unto them or make use of it for their benefit , as the Lord shall direct them , for thus it seemeth me good .
104 And let all those who have not families , who receive a money , send it up unto the bishop in Zion , or unto the bishop in Ohio , that it may be consecrated for the bringing forth of the revelations and the printing thereof , and for establishing Zion .
105 And if any man shall give unto any of you a coat , or a suit , take the old and cast it unto the a poor , and go on your way rejoicing .
106 And if any man among you be a strong in the Spirit , let him take with him him that is b weak , that he may be c edified in all d meekness , that he may become strong also .
107 Therefore , take with you those who are ordained unto the a lesser priesthood , and send them b before you to make appointments , and to prepare the way , and to fill appointments that you yourselves are not able to fill .
108 Behold , this is the way that mine apostles , in ancient days , built up my church unto me .
109 Therefore , let every man stand in his own a office , and b labor in his own calling ; and let not the c head say unto the feet it hath no need of the feet ; for without the feet how shall the body be able to stand ?
110 Also the body hath need of every a member , that all may be b edified together , that the system may be kept perfect .
111 And behold , the a high priests should travel , and also the elders , and also the lesser b priests ; but the c deacons and d teachers should be appointed to e watch over the church , to be standing ministers unto the church .
112 And the bishop , Newel K. Whitney , also should travel round about and among all the churches , searching after the poor to a administer to their wants by b humbling the rich and the proud .
113 He should also employ an a agent to take charge and to do his secular business as he shall direct .
114 Nevertheless , let the bishop go unto the city of New York , also to the city of Albany , and also to the city of Boston , and warn the people of those a cities with the sound of the gospel , with a loud voice , of the b desolation and utter abolishment which await them if they do reject these things .
115 For if they do reject these things the hour of their judgment is nigh , and their house shall be left unto them a desolate .
116 Let him a trust in me and he shall not be b confounded ; and a c hair of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed .
117 And verily I say unto you , the rest of my servants , go ye forth as your circumstances shall permit , in your several callings , unto the great and notable cities and villages , a reproving the world in righteousness of all their unrighteous and ungodly deeds , setting forth clearly and understandingly the desolation of b abomination in the last days .
118 For , with you saith the Lord a Almighty , I will b rend their c kingdoms ; I will not only d shake the earth , but the e starry heavens shall tremble .
119 For I , the Lord , have put forth my hand to exert the a powers of heaven ; ye cannot see it now , yet a b little while and ye shall see it , and know that I am , and that c I will d come and reign with my people .
120 I am a Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end .
Joseph Smith tells of his ancestry , family members , and their early abodes — An unusual excitement about religion prevails in western New York — He determines to seek wisdom as directed by James — The Father and the Son appear and Joseph is called to his prophetic ministry .
2 In this history I shall present the various events in relation to this Church , in truth and righteousness , as they have transpired , or as they at present exist , being now &#91; 1838 &#93; the a eighth b year since the organization of the said Church .
3 a I was born in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and five , on the twenty ##AT##-##AT## third day of December , in the town of Sharon , Windsor county , State of Vermont . .
4 His family consisting of eleven souls , namely , my father , Joseph Smith ; my a mother , Lucy Smith ( whose name , previous to her marriage , was Mack , daughter of Solomon Mack ) ; my brothers , b Alvin ( who died November 19th , 1823 , in the 26th year of his age ) , c Hyrum , myself , d Samuel Harrison , William , Don Carlos ; and my sisters , Sophronia , Catherine , and Lucy .
5 Some time in the second year after our removal to Manchester , there was in the place where we lived an unusual excitement on the subject of religion .
It commenced with the Methodists , but soon became general among all the sects in that region of country .
Indeed , the whole district of country seemed affected by it , and great multitudes united themselves to the different religious parties , which created no small stir and division amongst the people , some crying , “ a Lo , here ! ” and others , “ Lo , there ! ” Some were contending for the Methodist faith , some for the Presbyterian , and some for the Baptist .
7 I was at this time in my fifteenth year .
My father ’ s family was proselyted to the Presbyterian faith , and four of them joined that church , namely , my mother , Lucy ; my brothers Hyrum and Samuel Harrison ; and my sister Sophronia .
8 During this time of great excitement my mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness ; but though my feelings were deep and often poignant , still I kept myself aloof from all these parties , though I attended their several meetings as often as occasion would permit .
In process of time my mind became somewhat partial to the Methodist sect , and I felt some desire to be united with them ; but so great were the confusion and a strife among the different denominations , that it was impossible for a person young as I was , and so unacquainted with men and things , to come to any certain conclusion who was b right and who was wrong .
9 My mind at times was greatly excited , the cry and tumult were so great and incessant .
The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists , and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to prove their errors , or , at least , to make the people think they were in error .
On the other hand , the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and disprove all others .
10 In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions , I often said to myself : What is to be done ?
Who of all these parties are right ; or , are they all wrong together ?
If any one of them be a right , which is it , and how shall I know it ?
11 While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists , I was one day reading the Epistle of a James , first chapter and fifth verse , which reads : If any of you lack b wisdom , let him ask of God , that giveth to all men liberally , and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him .
12 Never did any passage of a scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine .
It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart .
I reflected on it again and again , knowing that if any person needed b wisdom from God , I did ; for how to act I did not know , and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had , I would never know ; for the teachers of religion of the different sects c understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible .
13 At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in a darkness and confusion , or else I must do as James directs , that is , ask of God .
I at length came to the determination to “ ask of God , ” concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom , and would b give liberally , and not upbraid , I might venture .
14 So , in accordance with this , my determination to ask of God , I retired to the a woods to make the attempt .
It was on the morning of a b beautiful , clear day , early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty .
It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt , for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to c pray d vocally .
15 After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go , having looked around me , and finding myself alone , I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God .
I had scarcely done so , when immediately I was a seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me , and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak .
Thick b darkness gathered around me , and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction .
17 It no sooner appeared than I found myself a delivered from the enemy which held me bound .
When the light rested upon me I b saw two c Personages , whose brightness and d glory defy all description , e standing above me in the air .
One of them spake unto me , calling me by name and said , pointing to the other — This is My f Beloved g Son .
18 My object in going to a inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right , that I might know which to join .
No sooner , therefore , did I get possession of myself , so as to be able to speak , than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light , which of all the sects was right ( for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong ) — and which I should join .
20 He again forbade me to join with any of them ; and many other things did he say unto me , which I cannot write at this time .
When I came to myself again , I found myself a lying on my back , looking up into heaven .
When the light had departed , I had no strength ; but soon recovering in some degree , I went home .
And as I leaned up to the fireplace , b mother inquired what the matter was .
I replied , “ Never mind , all is well — I am well enough off . ” I then said to my mother , “ I have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true . ” It seems as though the c adversary was aware , at a very early period of my life , that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom ; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me ?
Why the d opposition and persecution that arose against me , almost in my infancy ?
Some preachers and other professors of religion reject account of First Vision — Persecution heaped upon Joseph Smith — He testifies of the reality of the vision .
21 Some few days after I had this vision , I happened to be in company with one of the Methodist preachers , who was very active in the before mentioned religious excitement ; and , conversing with him on the subject of religion , I took occasion to give him an account of the vision which I had had .
I was greatly surprised at his behavior ; he treated my communication not only lightly , but with great contempt , saying it was all of the devil , that there were no such things as a visions or b revelations in these days ; that all such things had ceased with the apostles , and that there would never be any more of them .
23 It caused me serious reflection then , and often has since , how very strange it was that an obscure a boy , of a little over fourteen years of age , and one , too , who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily b labor , should be thought a character of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day , and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most bitter c persecution and d reviling .
But strange or not , so it was , and it was often the cause of great sorrow to myself .
24 However , it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a a vision .
I have thought since , that I felt much like Paul , when he made his defense before King Agrippa , and related the account of the vision he had when he saw a light , and heard a voice ; but still there were but few who believed him ; some said he was dishonest , others said he was b mad ; and he was ridiculed and reviled .
But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision .
He had seen a vision , he knew he had , and all the c persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise ; and though they should persecute him unto death , yet he knew , and would know to his latest breath , that he had both seen a light and heard a voice speaking unto him , and all the world could not make him think or believe otherwise .
25 So it was with me .
I had actually seen a light , and in the midst of that light I saw two a Personages , and they did in reality speak to me ; and though I was b hated and c persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision , yet it was true ; and while they were persecuting me , reviling me , and speaking all manner of evil against me d falsely for so saying , I was led to say in my heart : Why persecute me for telling the truth ?
I have actually seen a vision ; and who am I that I can withstand God , or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen ?
For I had seen a vision ; I knew it , and I knew that God knew it , and I could not e deny it , neither dared I do it ; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God , and come under condemnation .
26 I had now got my mind satisfied so far as the sectarian world was concerned — that it was not my duty to join with any of them , but to continue as I was until further a directed .
I had found the testimony of James to be true — that a man who lacked wisdom might ask of God , and obtain , and not be b upbraided .
Moroni appears to Joseph Smith — Joseph ’ s name is to be known for good and evil among all nations — Moroni tells him of the Book of Mormon and of the coming judgments of the Lord , and quotes many scriptures — The hiding place of the gold plates is revealed — Moroni continues to instruct the Prophet .
27 I continued to pursue my common vocations in life until the twenty ##AT##-##AT## first of September , one thousand eight hundred and twenty ##AT##-##AT## three , all the time suffering severe persecution at the hands of all classes of men , both religious and irreligious , because I continued to a affirm that I had seen a vision .
In making this confession , no one need suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins .
A disposition to commit such was never in my nature .
But I was guilty of d levity , and sometimes associated with jovial company , etc . , not consistent with that character which ought to be maintained by one who was e called of God as I had been .
But this will not seem very strange to any one who recollects my youth , and is acquainted with my native f cheery temperament .
30 While I was thus in the act of calling upon God , I discovered a a light appearing in my room , which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday , when immediately a b personage appeared at my bedside , standing in the air , for his feet did not touch the floor .
31 He had on a loose robe of most exquisite a whiteness .
It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen ; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant .
His hands were naked , and his arms also , a little above the wrist ; so , also , were his feet naked , as were his legs , a little above the ankles .
His head and neck were also bare .
I could discover that he had no other clothing on but this robe , as it was open , so that I could see into his bosom .
32 Not only was his robe exceedingly white , but his whole person was a glorious beyond description , and his countenance truly like b lightning .
The room was exceedingly light , but not so very bright as immediately around his person .
When I first looked upon him , I was c afraid ; but the d fear soon left me .
33 He called me by a name , and said unto me that he was a b messenger sent from the presence of God to me , and that his name was Moroni ; that God had a work for me to do ; and that my name should be had for c good and evil among all nations , kindreds , and tongues , or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people .
34 He said there was a a book deposited , written upon gold plates , giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent , and the source from whence they sprang .
35 Also , that there were two stones in silver bows — and these stones , fastened to a a breastplate , constituted what is called the b Urim and Thummim — deposited with the plates ; and the possession and use of these stones were what constituted “ c seers ” in ancient or former times ; and that God had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book .
36 After telling me these things , he commenced quoting the prophecies of the Old Testament .
He first quoted part of the third chapter of a Malachi ; and he quoted also the fourth or last chapter of the same prophecy , though with a little variation from the way it reads in our Bibles .
37 For behold , the a day cometh that shall b burn as an oven , and all the proud , yea , and all that do wickedly shall burn as c stubble ; for they that come shall burn them , saith the Lord of Hosts , that it shall leave them neither root nor branch .
38 And again , he quoted the fifth verse thus : Behold , I will reveal unto you the a Priesthood , by the hand of b Elijah the prophet , before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the c Lord .
39 He also quoted the next verse differently : And he shall plant in the hearts of the a children the b promises made to the fathers , and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers .
If it were not so , the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming .
40 In addition to these , he quoted the eleventh chapter of a Isaiah , saying that it was about to be fulfilled .
He quoted also the third chapter of Acts , twenty ##AT##-##AT## second and twenty ##AT##-##AT## third verses , precisely as they stand in our New Testament .
He said that that b prophet was Christ ; but the day had not yet come when “ they who would not hear his voice should be c cut off from among the people , ” but soon would come .
41 He also quoted the second chapter of a Joel , from the twenty ##AT##-##AT## eighth verse to the last .
He also said that this was not yet fulfilled , but was soon to be .
And he further stated that the fulness of the b Gentiles was soon to come in .
He quoted many other passages of scripture , and offered many explanations which c cannot be mentioned here .
42 Again , he told me , that when I got those plates of which he had spoken — for the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled — I should not show them to any person ; neither the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim ; only to those to whom I should be commanded to show them ; if I did I should be a destroyed .
While he was conversing with me about the plates , the vision was opened to my b mind that I could see the place where the plates were deposited , and that so clearly and distinctly that I knew the place again when I visited it .
43 After this communication , I saw the light in the room begin to gather immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me , and it continued to do so until the room was again left dark , except just around him ; when , instantly I saw , as it were , a conduit open right up into heaven , and he a ascended till he entirely disappeared , and the room was left as it had been before this heavenly light had made its appearance .
44 I lay musing on the singularity of the scene , and marveling greatly at what had been told to me by this extraordinary messenger ; when , in the midst of my a meditation , I suddenly discovered that my room was again beginning to get lighted , and in an instant , as it were , the same heavenly messenger was again by my bedside .
45 He commenced , and a again related the very same things which he had done at his first visit , without the least variation ; which having done , he informed me of great b judgments which were coming upon the earth , with great desolations by c famine , d sword , and pestilence ; and that these grievous judgments would come on the earth in this generation .
Having related these things , he again ascended as he had done before .
46 By this time , so deep were the impressions made on my mind , that sleep had fled from my eyes , and I lay overwhelmed in a astonishment at what I had both seen and heard .
But what was my surprise when again I beheld the same messenger at my bedside , and heard him rehearse or repeat over again to me the same things as before ; and added a caution to me , telling me that Satan would try to b tempt me ( in consequence of the indigent circumstances of my father ’ s family ) , to get the plates for the purpose of getting c rich .
This he forbade me , saying that I must have no other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God , and must not be influenced by any other d motive than that of building his kingdom ; otherwise I could not get them .
47 After this third visit , he again ascended into heaven as before , and I was again left to a ponder on the strangeness of what I had just experienced ; when almost immediately after the heavenly messenger had ascended from me for the third time , the cock crowed , and I found that day was approaching , so that our interviews must have occupied the whole of that night .
48 I shortly after arose from my bed , and , as usual , went to the necessary labors of the day ; but , in attempting to work as at other times , I found my a strength so exhausted as to render me entirely unable .
My father , who was laboring along with me , discovered something to be wrong with me , and told me to go home .
I started with the intention of going to the house ; but , in attempting to cross the fence out of the field where we were , my strength entirely failed me , and I b fell helpless on the ground , and for a time was quite unconscious of anything .
49 The first thing that I can recollect was a voice speaking unto me , calling me by name .
I looked up , and beheld the same messenger standing over my head , surrounded by light as before .
He then again related unto me all that he had related to me the previous night , and commanded me to go to my a father and tell him of the vision and commandments which I had received .
50 I obeyed ; I returned to my a father in the field , and rehearsed the whole matter to him .
He b replied to me that it was of God , and told me to go and do as commanded by the messenger .
I left the field , and went to the place where the messenger had told me the plates were deposited ; and owing to the distinctness of the vision which I had had concerning it , I knew the place the instant that I arrived there .
51 Convenient to the village of Manchester , Ontario county , New York , stands a a hill of considerable size , and the most elevated of any in the neighborhood .
On the west side of this hill , not far from the top , under a stone of considerable size , lay the plates , deposited in a stone box .
This stone was thick and rounding in the middle on the upper side , and thinner towards the edges , so that the middle part of it was visible above the ground , but the edge all around was covered with earth .
52 Having removed the earth , I obtained a lever , which I got fixed under the edge of the stone , and with a little exertion raised it up .
I looked in , and there indeed did I behold the a plates , the b Urim and Thummim , and the breastplate , as stated by the messenger .
The box in which they lay was formed by laying stones together in some kind of cement .
In the bottom of the box were laid two stones crossways of the box , and on these stones lay the plates and the other things with them .
53 I made an attempt to take them out , but was forbidden by the messenger , and was again informed that the time for bringing them forth had not yet arrived , neither would it , until four years from that time ; but he told me that I should come to that place precisely in one year from that time , and that he would there meet with me , and that I should continue to do so until the time should come for obtaining the plates .
54 Accordingly , as I had been commanded , I went at the end of each year , and at each time I found the same messenger there , and received instruction and intelligence from him at each of our interviews , respecting what the Lord was going to do , and how and in what manner his a kingdom was to be conducted in the last days .
Joseph Smith marries Emma Hale — He receives the gold plates from Moroni and translates some of the characters — Martin Harris shows characters and translation to Professor Anthon , who says : “ I cannot read a sealed book . ” ( Verses 55 ##AT##-##AT## 65 .
55 As my father ’ s worldly circumstances were very limited , we were under the necessity of a laboring with our hands , hiring out by day ’ s work and otherwise , as we could get opportunity .
Sometimes we were at home , and sometimes abroad , and by continuous b labor were enabled to get a comfortable maintenance .
56 In the year 1823 my father ’ s family met with a great a affliction by the death of my eldest brother , b Alvin .
In the month of October , 1825 , I hired with an old gentleman by the name of Josiah Stoal , who lived in Chenango county , State of New York .
He had heard something of a silver mine having been opened by the Spaniards in Harmony , Susquehanna county , State of Pennsylvania ; and had , previous to my hiring to him , been digging , in order , if possible , to discover the mine .
After I went to live with him , he took me , with the rest of his hands , to dig for the silver mine , at which I continued to work for nearly a month , without success in our undertaking , and finally I prevailed with the old gentleman to cease digging after it .
Hence arose the very prevalent story of my having been a money ##AT##-##AT## digger .
57 During the time that I was thus employed , I was put to board with a Mr. Isaac Hale , of that place ; it was there I first saw my wife ( his daughter ) , Emma Hale .
On the 18th of January , 1827 , we were married , while I was yet employed in the service of Mr. Stoal .
58 Owing to my continuing to assert that I had seen a vision , a persecution still followed me , and my wife ’ s father ’ s family were very much opposed to our being married .
I was , therefore , under the necessity of taking her elsewhere ; so we went and were married at the house of Squire Tarbill , in South Bainbridge , Chenango county , New York .
Immediately after my marriage , I left Mr. Stoal ’ s , and went to my father ’ s , and b farmed with him that season .
59 At length the time arrived for obtaining the plates , the Urim and Thummim , and the breastplate .
60 I soon found out the reason why I had received such strict charges to keep them safe , and why it was that the messenger had said that when I had done what was required at my hand , he would call for them .
For no sooner was it known that I had them , than the most strenuous exertions were used to a get them from me .
Every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to for that purpose .
The persecution became more bitter and severe than before , and multitudes were on the alert continually to get them from me if possible .
But by the wisdom of God , they remained safe in my hands , until I had accomplished by them what was required at my hand .
When , according to arrangements , the messenger called for them , I delivered them up to him ; and he has them in his charge until this b day , being the second day of May , one thousand eight hundred and thirty ##AT##-##AT## eight .
61 The excitement , however , still continued , and rumor with her thousand tongues was all the time employed in circulating a falsehoods about my father ’ s family , and about myself .
If I were to relate a thousandth part of them , it would fill up volumes .
The persecution , however , became so intolerable that I was under the necessity of leaving Manchester , and going with my wife to Susquehanna county , in the State of Pennsylvania .
While preparing to start — being very poor , and the persecution so heavy upon us that there was no probability that we would ever be otherwise — in the midst of our afflictions we found a friend in a gentleman by the name of b Martin Harris , who came to us and gave me fifty dollars to assist us on our journey .
Mr. Harris was a resident of Palmyra township , Wayne county , in the State of New York , and a farmer of respectability .
62 By this timely aid was I enabled to reach the place of my destination in Pennsylvania ; and immediately after my arrival there I commenced copying the characters off the plates .
I copied a considerable number of them , and by means of the a Urim and Thummim I translated some of them , which I did between the time I arrived at the house of my wife ’ s father , in the month of December , and the February following .
63 Sometime in this month of February , the aforementioned Mr. Martin Harris came to our place , got the characters which I had drawn off the plates , and started with them to the city of New York .
64 “ I went to the city of New York , and presented the characters which had been translated , with the translation thereof , to Professor Charles Anthon , a gentleman celebrated for his literary attainments .
Professor Anthon stated that the translation was correct , more so than any he had before seen translated from the Egyptian .
I then showed him those which were not yet translated , and he said that they were Egyptian , Chaldaic , Assyriac , and Arabic ; and he said they were true characters .
He gave me a certificate , certifying to the people of Palmyra that they were true characters , and that the translation of such of them as had been translated was also correct .
I took the certificate and put it into my pocket , and was just leaving the house , when Mr. Anthon called me back , and asked me how the young man found out that there were gold plates in the place where he found them .
I answered that an angel of God had revealed it unto him .
65 “ He then said to me , ‘ Let me see that certificate . ’ I accordingly took it out of my pocket and gave it to him , when he took it and tore it to pieces , saying that there was no such thing now as ministering of a angels , and that if I would bring the plates to him he would translate them .
I informed him that part of the plates were b sealed , and that I was forbidden to bring them .
Oliver Cowdery serves as scribe in translating the Book of Mormon — Joseph and Oliver receive the Aaronic Priesthood from John the Baptist — They are baptized , ordained , and receive the spirit of prophecy .
66 On the 5th day of April , 1829 , a Oliver Cowdery came to my house , until which time I had never seen him .
He stated to me that having been teaching school in the neighborhood where my father resided , and my father being one of those who sent to the school , he went to board for a season at his house , and while there the family related to him the circumstances of my having received the plates , and accordingly he had come to make inquiries of me .
67 Two days after the arrival of Mr. Cowdery ( being the 7th of April ) I commenced to translate the Book of Mormon , and he began to a write for me .
68 We still continued the work of translation , when , in the ensuing month ( May , 1829 ) , we on a certain day went into the woods to pray and inquire of the Lord respecting a baptism for the b remission of sins , that we found mentioned in the translation of the plates .
69 Upon you my fellow servants , in the name of Messiah , I confer the a Priesthood of b Aaron , which holds the keys of the ministering of angels , and of the gospel of repentance , and of c baptism by immersion for the remission of sins ; and this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of d Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in e righteousness .
70 He said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the power of laying on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost , but that this should be conferred on us hereafter ; and he commanded us to go and be baptized , and gave us directions that I should baptize Oliver Cowdery , and that afterwards he should baptize me .
71 Accordingly we went and were baptized .
I a baptized him first , and afterwards he baptized me — after which I laid my hands upon his head and ordained him to the Aaronic Priesthood , and afterwards he laid his hands on me and ordained me to the same Priesthood — for so we were commanded .
It was on the fifteenth day of May , 1829 , that we were ordained under the hand of this messenger , and baptized .
73 Immediately on our coming up out of the water after we had been baptized , we experienced great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father .
No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery , than the Holy Ghost fell upon him , and he stood up and a prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass .
And again , so soon as I had been baptized by him , I also had the spirit of prophecy , when , standing up , I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church , and many other things connected with the Church , and this generation of the children of men .
We were filled with the Holy Ghost , and rejoiced in the God of our salvation .
74 Our minds being now enlightened , we began to have the a scriptures laid open to our understandings , and the b true meaning and intention of their more c mysterious passages revealed unto us in a manner which we never could attain to previously , nor ever before had thought of .
In the meantime we were forced to keep secret the circumstances of having received the Priesthood and our having been baptized , owing to a spirit of persecution which had already manifested itself in the neighborhood .
75 We had been threatened with being mobbed , from time to time , and this , too , by professors of religion .
And their intentions of mobbing us were only counteracted by the influence of my wife ’ s father ’ s family ( under Divine providence ) , who had become very a friendly to me , and who were opposed to mobs , and were willing that I should be allowed to continue the work of translation without interruption ; and therefore offered and promised us protection from all unlawful proceedings , as far as in them lay .
King Benjamin continues his address — The Lord Omnipotent shall minister among men in a tabernacle of clay — Blood shall come from every pore as he atones for the sins of the world — His is the only name whereby salvation comes — Men can put off the natural man and become saints through the atonement — The torment of the wicked shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone .
1 And again my brethren , I would call your attention , for I have somewhat more to speak unto you ; for behold , I have things to tell you concerning that which is to come .
2 And the things which I shall tell you are made known unto me by an a angel from God .
And he said unto me : b Awake ; and I awoke , and behold he stood before me .
3 And he said unto me : Awake , and hear the words which I shall tell thee ; for behold , I am come to declare unto you the a glad tidings of great b joy .
4 For the Lord hath heard thy prayers , and hath judged of thy a righteousness , and hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou mayest rejoice ; and that thou mayest declare unto thy people , that they may also be filled with joy .
6 And he shall cast out a devils , or the b evil spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of men .
7 And lo , he shall a suffer b temptations , and pain of body , c hunger , thirst , and fatigue , even more than man can d suffer , except it be unto death ; for behold , e blood cometh from every pore , so great shall be his f anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people .
8 And he shall be called a Jesus b Christ , the c Son of God , the d Father of heaven and earth , the e Creator of all things from the beginning ; and his f mother shall be called Mary .
9 And lo , he cometh unto his own , that a salvation might come unto the children of men even through b faith on his name ; and even after all this they shall consider him a man , and say that he hath a c devil , and shall d scourge him , and shall e crucify him .
10 And he shall a rise the b third day from the dead ; and behold , he standeth to c judge the world ; and behold , all these things are done that a righteous judgment might come upon the children of men .
11 For behold , and also his a blood b atoneth for the sins of those who have c fallen by the transgression of Adam , who have died not knowing the d will of God concerning them , or who have e ignorantly sinned .
12 But wo , wo unto him who knoweth that he a rebelleth against God !
For salvation cometh to none such except it be through repentance and faith on the b Lord Jesus Christ .
13 And the Lord God hath sent his holy a prophets among all the children of men , to declare these things to every kindred , nation , and tongue , that thereby whosoever should believe that Christ should come , the same might receive b remission of their sins , and rejoice with exceedingly great joy , even c as though he had already come among them .
14 Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a a stiffnecked people , and he appointed unto them a b law , even the c law of Moses .
15 And many signs , and wonders , and a types , and shadows showed he unto them , concerning his coming ; and also holy prophets spake unto them concerning his coming ; and yet they b hardened their hearts , and understood not that the c law of Moses availeth nothing d except it were through the e atonement of his blood .
16 And even if it were possible that little a children could sin they could not be saved ; but I say unto you they are b blessed ; for behold , as in Adam , or by nature , they fall , even so the blood of Christ c atoneth for their sins .
17 And moreover , I say unto you , that there shall be a no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby b salvation can come unto the children of men , only in and through the name of Christ , the c Lord Omnipotent .
18 For behold he judgeth , and his judgment is just ; and the infant perisheth not that dieth in his infancy ; but men drink a damnation to their own souls except they humble themselves and b become as little children , and believe that c salvation was , and is , and is to come , in and through the d atoning blood of Christ , the Lord Omnipotent .
20 And moreover , I say unto you , that the time shall come when the a knowledge of a b Savior shall spread throughout c every nation , kindred , tongue , and people .
21 And behold , when that time cometh , none shall be found a blameless before God , except it be little children , only through repentance and faith on the name of the Lord God Omnipotent .
22 And even at this time , when thou shalt have taught thy people the things which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee , even then are they found no more blameless in the sight of God , only according to the words which I have spoken unto thee .
23 And now I have spoken the words which the Lord God hath commanded me .
24 And thus saith the Lord : They shall stand as a bright testimony against this people , at the judgment day ; whereof they shall be judged , every man according to his a works , whether they be good , or whether they be evil .
25 And if they be evil they are consigned to an awful a view of their own guilt and abominations , which doth cause them to shrink from the presence of the Lord into a state of b misery and c endless torment , from whence they can no more return ; therefore they have drunk damnation to their own souls .
26 Therefore , they have drunk out of the a cup of the wrath of God , which justice could no more deny unto them than it could deny that b Adam should fall because of his partaking of the forbidden c fruit ; therefore , d mercy could have claim on them no more forever .
27 And their a torment is as a b lake of fire and brimstone , whose flames are unquenchable , and whose smoke ascendeth up c forever and ever .
Thus hath the Lord commanded me .

Matter in the universe is not distributed randomly .
Galaxies , quasars , and intergalactic gas outline a pattern that has been compared to soap bubbles - large voids surrounded by thin walls of galaxies , with dense galactic clusters where walls intersect .
One of the primary goals of the SDSS is to map this structure in great detail , out to large distances .
Scientists have many theories about how the universe evolved , and the theories predict different different large ##AT##-##AT## scale structrues for the universe .
The SDSS &apos;s map may tell us which theories are right - or whether we will have to come up with entirely new ideas .
Galaxies are usually found near each other , in galactic clusters .
The distribution of these clusters , and how this distribution evolves with time , are important tests of cosmological models : for instance , different cosmological models predict different numbers of galaxy clusters at different redshifts .
Additionally , not only are galaxies clustered , but the clusters themselves are clustered !
The degree to which both galaxies and clusters tend to group together is also a test of different theories .
By studying the masses , distributions , and evolution of galaxy clusters , we can learn something about the formation of mass in the universe : a fundamental goal of cosmology .
Because galaxy clusters can be very massive ( up to 1014 times the mass of the Sun ) , their gravity is strong enough to hold on to extremely hot gas , with temperatures of millions of degrees .
This gas emits radiation at X ##AT##-##AT## ray wavelengths , which can be observed by X ##AT##-##AT## ray satellites like Chandra , ROSAT , and XMM .
These satellites have shown that a large fraction of clusters have structure and complicated internal motions , which indicate that they are still evolving .
Also , satellite observations have shown that the X ##AT##-##AT## ray emitting gas comprises the largest fraction of the visible mass in clusters , greater than the sum of all the galaxies .
This is a very interesting result - remember that galaxy clusters were discovered as overdensities of galaxies , and now we know that galaxies are but a small part of the total mass of clusters .
Some astronomers have even suggested clusters without galaxies may also exist - just huge clumps of gas .
Galaxy clusters have huge mass , and the Theory of General Relativity says massive objects bend light as it passes by them , a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing .
The amount of lensing caused by a galaxy cluster depends on the cluster &apos;s total mass , so by measuring the amount of lensing , we can weigh the clusters .
These measurements can be compared to other mass estimates , like the amount of X ##AT##-##AT## ray gas and the velocities of galaxies in the cluster .
With these mass estimates , we can compute the mass ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## light ( M / L ) ratios for clusters . This ratio allows us to estimate the bias , which tells us how galaxies are distributed relative to the rest of the matter .
The M / L ratios also help put constraints on the total mass in the universe .
If we add up the mass of the galaxies that we can see , plus the mass of X ##AT##-##AT## ray gas we have observed , and compare it to the total mass estimated for the cluster , we find that most of the matter is in some other form !
This extra mass is called dark matter because it does not emit light . In fact , it turns out that most of the universe seems to be made of dark matter , which we can &apos;t see directly , but whose existence we can infer due to its gravity .
Scientists have several theories about what dark matter could be , but no one knows for sure .
The discovery of dark matter is one of the greatest and most intriguing discoveries of the last decade .
Most elliptical and S0 galaxies are found in clusters , and more such galaxies are found in denser clusters .
Amazingly , astronomers do not have good explanations for why most clusters contain elliptical galaxies .
They also have a poor understanding of how galaxies in clusters evolve .
We know that there are apparently more blue galaxies in clusters as we look back in time , suggesting that there used to be more star formation .
Yet , we also see clusters with significant numbers of old , red galaxies even at redshifts of about 1 , when the universe was only a few billion years old .
Using the SDSS , we will be able to study these the types and masses of galaxies in thousands of clusters , far more than have ever been studied before .
Superclusters are simply clusters of galaxy clusters .
Whereas clusters are typically found in the filaments and walls of the universe &apos;s &quot; soap bubble , &quot; superclusters are at the intersections of the walls . Superclusters are the largest known structures in the universe , with some as large as 200,000,000 light ##AT##-##AT## years !
However , because these structures are very rare , only a few are known . The most famous superclusters are nearby , including the Great Wall and the Perseus ##AT##-##AT## Pisces supercluster .
There has been recent evidence for superclusters at redshifts of about 1 , which places important constraints on structure formation and cosmological models .
Additionally , the M / L ratios of superclusters are similar to those of clusters . This discovery implies that the mysterious dark matter cannot contribute more to the mass of the universe than it contributes to the mass of clusters .

Not to be believed , Apple and telephone operators have begun blocking Skype on the iPhone , really incredible .
And then they have been 2 million downloads of the software is quite likely that their calls have fallen , so cheap that it is Skype , and even for free between users .
That disappointment turned out to be Apple , I can understand that operators robofonía do , but I think Apple should not have accepted it , ever , ever , but well , I have no other to destroy my iPhone .
Already available in an update of the best players , the iTunes version 8.1.1 on , with some advantages as a carrier for the rental of movies in HD , in addition to patch some bugs related to the synchronization of the iPhone and iPod touch and VoiceOver functionality .
Our friends from engadget has made a video where we see the inside of the latest Mac Pro , mac this really beautiful , I think it is undoubtedly one of the best designs that can exist , but I already ordered one .

Alfred Abel ( 12 March 1879 – 12 December 1937 ) was a German film actor , director , and producer . He appeared in over 140 silent and sound films between 1913 and 1938 .
Abel is also known as the “ Lewis Stone of German films . ” &#91; 1 &#93; His most famous performance is his role as Joh Fredersen in Fritz Lang &apos; s 1927 film Metropolis .
The Bauhaus school was founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar . In spite of its name , and the fact that its founder was an architect , the Bauhaus did not have an architecture department during the first years of its existence .
Nonetheless it was founded with the idea of creating a &apos; total &apos; work of art in which all arts , including architecture would eventually be brought together .
The Bauhaus style became one of the most influential currents in Modernist architecture and modern design .
&#91; 1 &#93; The Bauhaus had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art , architecture , graphic design , interior design , industrial design , and typography .
The school existed in three German cities ( Weimar from 1919 to 1925 , Dessau from 1925 to 1932 and Berlin from 1932 to 1933 ) , under three different architect ##AT##-##AT## directors : Walter Gropius from 1919 to 1927 , Hannes Meyer from 1927 to 1930 and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1930 until 1933 , when the school was closed by the Nazi regime .
The changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus , technique , instructors , and politics . For instance : the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau , even though it had been an important revenue source ; when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930 , he transformed it into a private school , and would not allow any supporters of Hannes Meyer to attend it .
However , the most important influence on Bauhaus was modernism , a cultural movement whose origins lay as far back as the 1880s , and which had already made its presence felt in Germany before the World War , despite the prevailing conservatism .
The design innovations commonly associated with Gropius and the Bauhaus - the radically simplified forms , the rationality and functionality , and the idea that mass ##AT##-##AT## production was reconcilable with the individual artistic spirit - were already partly developed in Germany before the Bauhaus was founded .
The German national designers &apos; organization Deutscher Werkbund was formed in 1907 by Hermann Muthesius to harness the new potentials of mass production , with a mind towards preserving Germany &apos;s economic competitiveness with England .
In its first seven years , the Werkbund came to be regarded as the authoritative body on questions of design in Germany , and was copied in other countries . Many fundamental questions of craftsmanship vs. mass production , the relationship of usefulness and beauty , the practical purpose of formal beauty in a commonplace object , and whether or not a single proper form could exist , were argued out among its 1870 members ( by 1914 ) .
The entire movement of German architectural modernism was known as Neues Bauen .
Beginning in June 1907 , Peter Behrens &apos; pioneering industrial design work for the German electrical company AEG successfully integrated art and mass production on a large scale .
He designed consumer products , standardized parts , created clean ##AT##-##AT## lined designs for the company &apos;s graphics , developed a consistent corporate identity , built the modernist landmark AEG Turbine Factory , and made full use of newly developed materials such as poured concrete and exposed steel .
Behrens was a founding member of the Werkbund , and both Walter Gropius and Adolf Meier worked for him in this period .
The Bauhaus was founded at a time when the German zeitgeist ( &quot; spirit of the times &quot; ) had turned from emotional Expressionism to the matter ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## fact New Objectivity . An entire group of working architects , including Erich Mendelsohn , Bruno Taut and Hans Poelzig , turned away from fanciful experimentation , and turned toward rational , functional , sometimes standardized building .
Beyond the Bauhaus , many other significant German ##AT##-##AT## speaking architects in the 1920s responded to the same aesthetic issues and material possibilities as the school . They also responded to the promise of a &quot; minimal dwelling &quot; written into the new Weimar Constitution .
Ernst May , Bruno Taut , and Martin Wagner , among others , built large housing blocks in Frankfurt and Berlin . The acceptance of modernist design into everyday life was the subject of publicity campaigns , well ##AT##-##AT## attended public exhibitions like the Weissenhof Estate , films , and sometimes fierce public debate .
&#91; 9 &#93; In the pamphlet for an April 1919 exhibition entitled &quot; Exhibition of Unknown Architects &quot; , Gropius proclaimed his goal as being &quot; to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . &quot; Gropius &apos; neologism Bauhaus references both building and the Bauhütte , a premodern guild of stonemasons .
&#91; 10 &#93; The early intention was for the Bauhaus to be a combined architecture school , crafts school , and academy of the arts . In 1919 Swiss painter Johannes Itten , German ##AT##-##AT## American painter Lyonel Feininger , and German sculptor Gerhard Marcks , along with Gropius , comprised the faculty of the Bauhaus .
Gropius &apos;s design for the Dessau facilities was a return to the futuristic Gropius of 1914 that had more in common with the International style lines of the Fagus Factory than the stripped down Neo ##AT##-##AT## classical of the Werkbund pavilion or the Völkisch Sommerfeld House . &#91; 15 &#93; The Dessau years saw a remarkable change in direction for the school .
Meyer became director when Gropius resigned in February 1928 , and brought the Bauhaus its two most significant building commissions , both of which still exist : five apartment buildings in the city of Dessau , and the headquarters of the Federal School of the German Trade Unions ( ADGB ) in Bernau .
Meyer favored measurements and calculations in his presentations to clients , along with the use of off ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## shelf architectural components to reduce costs , and this approach proved attractive to potential clients .
The school turned its first profit under his leadership in 1929 .
But Meyer also generated a great deal of conflict .
As a radical functionalist , he had no patience with the aesthetic program , and forced the resignations of Herbert Bayer , Marcel Breuer , and other long ##AT##-##AT## time instructors .
As a vocal Communist , he encouraged the formation of a communist student organization .
In the increasingly dangerous political atmosphere , this became a threat to the existence of the Dessau school .
Meyer was also compromised by a sexual scandal involving one of his students , and Gropius fired him in 1930 .
The paradox of the early Bauhaus was that , although its manifesto proclaimed that the ultimate aim of all creative activity was building , the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927 .
The single most profitable tangible product of the Bauhaus was its wallpaper .
During the years under Gropius ( 1919 – 1927 ) , he and his partner Adolf Meyer observed no real distinction between the output of his architectural office and the school .
So the built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius : the Sommerfeld house in Berlin , the Otte house in Berlin , the Auerbach house in Jena , and the competition design for the Chicago Tribune Tower , which brought the school much attention . The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius .
In the next two years under Meyer , the architectural focus shifted away from aesthetics and towards functionality .
There were major commissions : one from the city of Dessau for five tightly designed &quot; Laubenganghäuser &quot; ( apartment buildings with balcony access ) , which are still in use today , and another for the headquarters of the Federal School of the German Trade Unions ( ADGB ) in Bernau bei Berlin . Meyer &apos;s approach was to research users &apos; needs and scientifically develop the design solution .
Mies van der Rohe repudiated Meyer &apos;s politics , his supporters , and his architectural approach .
As opposed to Gropius &apos;s &quot; study of essentials &quot; , and Meyer &apos;s research into user requirements , Mies advocated a &quot; spatial implementation of intellectual decisions &quot; , which effectively meant an adoption of his own aesthetics .
Neither van der Rohe nor his Bauhaus students saw any projects built during the 1930s .
The popular conception of the Bauhaus as the source of extensive Weimar ##AT##-##AT## era working housing is not accurate . Two projects , the apartment building project in Dessau and the Törten row housing also in Dessau , fall in that category , but developing worker housing was not the first priority of Gropius nor Mies .
The Bauhaus had a major impact on art and architecture trends in Western Europe , the United States , Canada and Israel ( particularly in White City , Tel Aviv ) in the decades following its demise , as many of the artists involved fled , or were exiled , by the Nazi regime .
Tel Aviv , in fact , has been named to the list of world heritage sites by the UN due to its abundance of Bauhaus architecture in 2004 &#91; 17 &#93; &#91; 18 &#93; ; it had some 4000 Bauhaus buildings erected from 1933 on .
In the late 1930s , Mies van der Rohe re ##AT##-##AT## settled in Chicago , enjoyed the sponsorship of the influential Philip Johnson , and became one of the pre ##AT##-##AT## eminent architects in the world . Moholy ##AT##-##AT## Nagy also went to Chicago and founded the New Bauhaus school under the sponsorship of industrialist and philanthropist Walter Paepcke .
Herbert Bayer , sponsored by Paepcke , moved to Aspen , Colorado in support of Paepcke &apos;s Aspen projects at the Aspen Institute . In 1953 , Max Bill , together with Inge Aicher ##AT##-##AT## Scholl and Otl Aicher , founded the Ulm School of Design ( German : Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm ) in Ulm , Germany , a design school in the tradition of the Bauhaus .
One of the main objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art , craft , and technology . The machine was considered a positive element , and therefore industrial and product design were important components .
Vorkurs ( &quot; initial &quot; or &quot; preliminary course &quot; ) was taught ; this is the modern day &quot; Basic Design &quot; course that has become one of the key foundational courses offered in architectural and design schools across the globe . There was no teaching of history in the school because everything was supposed to be designed and created according to first principles rather than by following precedent .
One of the most important contributions of the Bauhaus is in the field of modern furniture design . The ubiquitous Cantilever chair by Dutch designer Mart Stam , using the tensile properties of steel , and the Wassily Chair designed by Marcel Breuer are two examples .
After German reunification , a reorganized school continued in the same building , with no essential continuity with the Bauhaus under Gropius in the early 1920s &#91; 20 &#93; . In 1979 Bauhaus ##AT##-##AT## Dessau College started to organize postgraduate programs with participants from all over the world .
American art schools have also rediscovered the Bauhaus school .
The Master Craftsman Program at Florida State University bases its artistic philosophy on Bauhaus theory and practice .

Edward Benjamin Britten , Baron Britten , OM CH ( 22 November 1913 – 4 December 1976 ) was an English composer , conductor , violist and pianist .
Britten was born in Lowestoft , Suffolk , the son of a dentist and a talented amateur musician . He showed musical gifts very early in life , and began composing prolifically as a child .
He was educated at Old Buckenham Hall School in Suffolk , an all ##AT##-##AT## boys prep school , and Gresham &apos;s School , Holt .
In 1927 , he began private lessons with Frank Bridge ; he also studied , less happily , at the Royal College of Music under John Ireland , with some input from Ralph Vaughan Williams .
Although ultimately held back by his parents ( at the suggestion of College staff ) , Britten had also intended to study with Alban Berg in Vienna . Britten was a prolific juvenile composer ; some 800 works and fragments precede his early published works .
His first compositions to attract wide attention , however , were the Sinfonietta Op. 1 , &quot; A Hymn to the Virgin &quot; ( 1930 ) and a set of choral variations A Boy was Born , written in 1934 for the BBC Singers .
In April 1935 , he was approached by the film director Alberto Cavalcanti to write the film score for the documentary The King &apos;s Stamp , produced by the GPO Film Unit . &#91; 1 &#93; He subsequently met W. H. Auden , who was also working for the GPO Film Unit : together they worked on the films Coal Face and Night Mail .
Of more lasting importance to Britten was his meeting in 1937 with the tenor Peter Pears , who was to become his musical collaborator and inspiration as well as his life partner . In the same year he composed a Pacifist March ( words , Ronald Duncan ) for the Peace Pledge Union , of which , as a pacifist , he had become an active member , but the work was not a success and soon withdrawn .
One of Britten &apos;s most noteworthy works from the 1930s was Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge for string orchestra , Op.
There , in 1940 , Britten composed Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo , the first of many song cycles for Pears . Already friends with the composer Aaron Copland , Britten encountered his latest works Billy the Kid and An Outdoor Overture , both of which manifestly influenced his own music .
&#91; 3 &#93; While in America Britten wrote his first music drama , Paul Bunyan , an operetta ( to a libretto by Auden ) . The period in America was also remarkable for a number of orchestral works , including the Violin Concerto Op.
Peter Grimes was the first in a series of English operas , of which Billy Budd ( 1951 ) and The Turn of the Screw ( 1954 ) were particularly admired .
His Shakespeare opera , A Midsummer Night &apos;s Dream , followed in 1960 . These operas share common themes .
For example , most feature an &apos; outsider &apos; character , who is excluded or misunderstood by society . Often this is the eponymous protagonist , as in Peter Grimes and Owen Wingrave .
An increasingly important influence was the music of the East , an interest that was fostered by a tour with Pears in 1957 , when Britten was struck by the music of the Balinese gamelan and by Japanese Noh plays .
The fruits of this tour include the ballet The Prince of the Pagodas ( 1957 ) and the series of semi ##AT##-##AT## operatic &quot; Parables for Church Performance &quot; : Curlew River ( 1964 ) , The Burning Fiery Furnace ( 1966 ) and The Prodigal Son ( 1968 ) .
The greatest success of Britten &apos;s career was , however , the musically more conventional War Requiem , written for the 1962 consecration of the newly reconstructed Coventry Cathedral .
Britten developed close friendships with the Russians Dmitri Shostakovich and Mstislav Rostropovich in the 1960s : he composed his Cello Suites , Cello Symphony and Cello Sonata for the latter , and conducted the first Western performance of the former &apos;s Fourteenth Symphony . Shostakovich dedicated this score to Britten , and often spoke very highly of his music .
Britten himself had previously dedicated &apos; The Prodigal Son &apos; ( the third and last of the &apos; Church Parables &apos; ) to Shostakovich . He was honoured again by appointment to the Order of Merit ( OM ) on 23 March 1965 .
In his last decade or so , Britten suffered from increasingly poor health . His late works became progressively more sparse in texture .
They include the operas Owen Wingrave ( 1970 ) and Death in Venice ( 1971 ##AT##-##AT## 3 ) , the Suite on English Folk Tunes &quot; A Time There Was &quot; ( 1974 ) and Third String Quartet ( 1975 ) — which drew on material from Death in Venice — as well as the dramatic cantata Phaedra ( 1975 ) , written for Janet Baker .
Having previously declined a knighthood , Britten accepted a life peerage on 2 July 1976 as Baron Britten , of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk .
&#91; 6 &#93; A few months later he died of heart failure at his house in Aldeburgh . He is buried in the churchyard of St. Peter and St. Paul &apos;s Church there .
The grave of his partner , Sir Peter Pears lies next to his , close to the grave of Imogen Holst , a close friend .
Britten was an accomplished pianist , frequently performing chamber music and accompanying lieder and song recitals . However , apart from the Holiday Diary ( 1934 ) , Piano Concerto ( 1938 ) , Young Apollo ( 1939 ) , Diversions ( written for Paul Wittgenstein in 1940 ) , Scottish Ballad ( 1941 ) , he wrote relatively little music that puts the piano in the spotlight , and in a 1963 interview for the BBC said that he thought of it as &quot; a background instrument &quot; .

David Hackett Souter ( pronounced / ˈsuːtər / ; born September 17 , 1939 ) served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1990 until his retirement from the Court effective June 29 , 2009 .
Souter was born in Melrose , Massachusetts , September 17 , 1939 .
He is the only child of Joseph Alexander Souter ( 1904 – 1976 ) and Helen Adams Hackett Souter ( 1907 – 1995 ) .
&#91; 3 &#93; &#91; 4 &#93; After moving from Melrose at the age of 11 , he spent most of his childhood and adolescence at his family &apos;s farm in Weare , New Hampshire .
&#91; 3 &#93; He attended Concord High School in New Hampshire .
He went on to Harvard College , from which he received his A.B. , concentrating in philosophy and writing a senior thesis on the legal positivism of Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr . , the famous Supreme Court justice .
In 1961 , he graduated from Harvard magna cum laude as a member of Phi Beta Kappa . He was selected as a Rhodes Scholar and earned an M.A.
from Magdalen College , Oxford , in 1963 . He then entered Harvard Law School , graduating in 1966 .
Souter worked as an associate at Orr &amp; Reno in Concord , New Hampshire , from 1966 to 1968 ; he disliked private practice .
&#91; 3 &#93; He accepted a position as an Assistant Attorney General of New Hampshire in 1968 , beginning his lifelong career in public service .
As Assistant Attorney General he worked in the criminal division , prosecuting cases in the courts .
In 1971 , Warren Rudman , then the Attorney General of New Hampshire , selected him to be the Deputy Attorney General .
Warren Rudman , who had since been elected a senator , and former New Hampshire Governor John H. Sununu , then chief of staff to President George H. W. Bush , were instrumental in both his nomination and his confirmation to the Supreme Court .
Prior to Sununu &apos;s recommendation , few observers outside of New Hampshire knew who Souter was , &#91; 5 &#93; although he had been mentioned by The New York Times as one of Reagan &apos;s four top nominees for the Supreme Court slot that eventually went to Anthony Kennedy .
Bush originally wanted to appoint Clarence Thomas to Brennan &apos;s seat , but ultimately decided that Thomas did not have enough experience as a federal judge and decided to recommend Souter for the post instead .
Souter , along with former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Stephen Breyer , has a reputation for being a strong guardian of the Court &apos;s institutional integrity .
&#91; citation needed &#93; &#91; clarification needed &#93; A traditionalist in this regard , he stated in response to proposals to videotape oral arguments before the Supreme Court : &quot; I can tell you the day you see a camera come into our courtroom , it &apos;s going to roll over my dead body .
On April 30 , 2009 , NPR reported that Justice Souter planned to retire at the end of the October 2008 term of the court , in June 2009 , or as soon thereafter as his successor was confirmed .
Subsequently , Souter &apos;s retirement was announced by President Barack Obama , at an unanticipated appearance at the daily White House press briefing on May 1 , 2009 . The same day , the Supreme Court released a letter from Justice Souter to the President , which indicated that Souter would be retiring when the court rose for its summer recess .
The letter did not state that Souter would stay on the court until his successor was confirmed , meaning that he would leave the Court by the end of June .
It did state that Souter intended &quot; to continue to render substantial judicial service as an Associate Justice &quot; — an apparent reference to the ability of a retired justice to serve by designation as a judge of a United States Court of Appeals or United States District Court .
Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez ( June 6 , 1599 – August 6 , 1660 ) was a Spanish painter who was the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV .
He was an individualistic artist of the contemporary baroque period , important as a portrait artist .
In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance , he painted scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family , other notable European figures , and commoners , culminating in the production of his masterpiece Las Meninas ( 1656 ) .
From the first quarter of the nineteenth century , Velázquez &apos;s artwork was a model for the realist and impressionist painters , in particular Édouard Manet .
Since that time , more modern artists , including Spain &apos;s Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí , as well as the Anglo ##AT##-##AT## Irish painter Francis Bacon , have paid tribute to Velázquez by recreating several of his most famous works .
After leaving Herrera &apos;s studio when he was 12 years old , Velázquez began to serve as an apprentice under Francisco Pacheco , an artist and teacher in Seville .
Though considered a generally dull , undistinguished painter , Pacheco sometimes expressed a simple , direct realism in contradiction to the style of Raphael that he was taught .
Velázquez remained in Pacheco &apos;s school for five years , studying proportion and perspective and witnessing the trends in the literary and artistic circles of Seville .
By the early 1620s , his position and reputation were assured in Seville .
In 1618 , Velázquez married Juana Pacheco ( June 1 , 1602 - August 10 , 1660 ) , the daughter of his teacher . She bore him two daughters — his only known family .
The younger , Ignacia de Silva Velázquez y Pacheco , died in infancy , while the elder , Francisca de Silva Velázquez y Pacheco ( 1619 ##AT##-##AT## 1658 ) , married painter Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo at the Church of Santiago in Madrid on August 21 , 1633 .
Velázquez produced other notable works in this time .
Sacred subjects are depicted in Adoración de los Reyes ( 1619 , The Adoration of the Magi ) , and Jesús y los peregrinos de Emaús ( 1626 , Christ and the Pilgrims of Emmaus ) , both of which begin to express his more pointed and careful realism .
Velázquez went to Madrid in the first half of April 1622 , with letters of introduction to Don Juan de Fonseca , himself from Seville , who was chaplain to the King .
At the request of Pacheco , Velázquez painted the portrait of the famous poet Luis de Góngora y Argote .
Velázquez painted Góngora crowned with a laurel wreath , but painted over it at some unknown later date .
It is possible that Velázquez stopped in Toledo on his way from Seville , on the advice of Pacheco , or back from Madrid on that of Góngora , a great admirer of El Greco , having composed a poem on the occasion of his death .
In December 1622 , Rodrigo de Villandrando , the king &apos;s favorite court painter , died . Don Juan de Fonseca conveyed to Velázquez the command to come to the court from the Count ##AT##-##AT## Duke of Olivares , the powerful minister of Philip IV .
He was offered 50 ducats ( 175 g of gold — worth about € 2000 in 2005 ) to defray his expenses , and he was accompanied by his father ##AT##-##AT## in ##AT##-##AT## law . Fonseca lodged the young painter in his own home and sat for a portrait himself , which , when completed , was conveyed to the royal palace .
Olivares commanded Velázquez to move to Madrid , promising that no other painter would ever paint Philip &apos;s portrait and all other portraits of the king would be withdrawn from circulation . In the following year , 1624 , he received 300 ducats from the king to pay the cost of moving his family to Madrid , which became his home for the remainder of his life .
Through a bust portrait of the king , painted in 1623 , Velázquez secured admission to the royal service , with a salary of 20 ducats per month , besides medical attendance , lodgings and payment for the pictures he might paint . The portrait was exhibited on the steps of San Felipe and was received with enthusiasm .
1070 and 1071 ) in which the severity of the Seville period has disappeared and the tones are more delicate . The modeling is firm , recalling that of Antonio Mor , the Dutch portrait painter of Philip II , who exercised a considerable influence on the Spanish school .
Records indicate that he sat for Velázquez , but the picture is now lost . In September 1628 , Peter Paul Rubens came to Madrid as an emissary from the Infanta Isabella , and Velázquez kept his company among the Titians at the Escorial .
His picture was destroyed in a fire at the palace in 1734 . Recorded descriptions of it say that it depicted Philip III pointing with his baton to a crowd of men and women driven off under charge of soldiers , while the female personification of Spain sits in calm repose .
Velázquez was appointed gentleman usher as reward .
Later he also received a daily allowance of 12 réis , the same amount allotted to the court barbers , and 90 ducats a year for dress .
Five years after he painted it in 1629 , as an extra payment , he received 100 ducats for the picture of Bacchus ( The Feast of Bacchus ) .
The spirit and aim of this work are better understood from its Spanish name , Los Borrachos ( The Drunks ) or Los Bebedores ( the drinkers ) , who are paying mock homage to a half ##AT##-##AT## naked ivy ##AT##-##AT## crowned young man seated on a wine barrel .
The painting is firm and solid , and the light and shade are more deftly handled than in former works .
Altogether , this production may be taken as the most advanced example of the first style of Velázquez .
In 1629 , he went to live in Italy for a year and a half . Though his first Italian visit is recognized as a crucial chapter in the development of Velázquez &apos;s style - and in the history of Spanish Royal Patronage , since Philip IV sponsored his trip - we know rather little about the details and specifics : what the painter saw , whom he met , how he was perceived and what innovations he hoped to introduce into his painting .
It is canonical to divide the artistic career of Velázquez by his two visits to Italy , with his second grouping of works following the first visit and his third grouping following the second visit . This somewhat arbitrary division may be accepted though it will not always apply , because , as is usual in the case of many painters , his styles at times overlap each other .
Velázquez rarely signed his pictures , and the royal archives give the dates of only his most important works . Internal evidence and history pertaining to his portraits supply the rest to a certain extent .
His impassive , saturnine face is familiar to us from the many portraits painted by Velázquez .
Two are notable ; one is a full ##AT##-##AT## length , stately and dignified , in which he wears the green cross of the order of Alcantara and holds a wand , the badge of his office as master of the horse , the other , a great equestrian portrait in which he is flatteringly represented as a field marshal during action .
In these portraits , Velázquez has well repaid the debt of gratitude that he owed to his first patron , whom Velázquez stood by during Olivares &apos;s fall from power , thus exposing himself to the great risk of the anger of the jealous Philip . The king , however , showed no sign of malice towards his favorite painter .
The sculptor Juan Martínez Montañés modeled a statue of one of Velázquez &apos;s equestrian portraits of the king , painted in 1636 , which was cast in bronze by the Florentine sculptor Pietro Tacca and which now stands in the Plaza de Oriente at Madrid &#91; 2 &#93; .
The original of this portrait no longer exists , but several others do .
Velázquez , in this and in all his portraits of the king , depicts Philip wearing the golilla , a stiff linen collar projecting at right angles from the neck . It was invented by the king , who was so proud of it that he celebrated it by a festival followed by a procession to the church to thank God for the blessing .
Thus , the golilla was the height of fashion , and appeared in most of the male portraits of the period .
Velázquez was in constant and close attendance on Philip , accompanying him in his journeys to Aragon in 1642 and 1644 , and was doubtless present with him when he entered Lerida as a conqueror .
It was then that he painted a great equestrian portrait in which the king is represented as a great commander leading his troops — a role which Philip never played except in pageantry .
All is full of animation except the stolid face of the king .
It hangs as a pendant to the great Olivares portrait — fit rivals of the neighboring Charles V by Titian , which inspired Velázquez to excel himself , and both remarkable for their silvery tone and their feeling of open air .
One wonders who the beautiful woman can be who adorns the Wallace collection , a brunette so unlike the usual fair ##AT##-##AT## haired female sitters to Velázquez .
This picture is one of the ornaments of the Wallace collection . However , if few ladies of the court of Philip have been depicted , Velázquez painted several of his buffoons and dwarfs .
Velázquez appears to represent them with respect and sympathetically , as in El Primo ( 1644 , English : The Favorite ) , whose intelligent face and huge folio with ink ##AT##-##AT## bottle and pen by his side show him to be a wiser and better ##AT##-##AT## educated man than many of the gallants of the court .
Pablo de Valladolid ( 1635 , English : Paul of Valladolid ) , a buffoon evidently acting a part , and El Bobo de Coria ( 1639 , English : The Buffoon of Coria ) belong to this middle period .
The greatest of the religious paintings by Velázquez also belongs to this middle period , the Cristo Crucificado ( 1632 , English : Christ on the Cross ) .
It is a work of tremendous originality , depicting Christ immediately after death .
The Savior &apos;s head hangs on his breast and a mass of dark tangled hair conceals part of the face .
The picture was lengthened to suit its place in an oratory , but this addition has since been removed .
Some believe that the man in this painting is his uncle .
Philip now entrusted Velázquez with carrying out a design on which he had long set his heart : the founding of an academy of art in Spain . Rich in pictures , Spain was weak in statuary , and Velázquez was commissioned once again to proceed to Italy to make purchases .
Those works presage the advent of the painter &apos;s third and latest manner , a noble example of which is the great portrait of Pope Innocent X in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery in Rome , where Velázquez now proceeded .
There he was received with marked favor by the Pope , who presented him with a medal and golden chain .
Velázquez took a copy of the portrait — which Sir Joshua Reynolds thought was the finest picture in Rome — with him to Spain .
Several copies of it exist in different galleries , some of them possibly studies for the original or replicas painted for Philip . Velázquez , in this work , had now reached the manera abreviada , a term coined by contemporary Spaniards for this bolder , sharper style .
The portrait shows such ruthlessness in Innocent &apos;s expression that some in the Vatican feared that Velázquez would meet with the Pope &apos;s displeasure , but Innocent was well pleased with the work , hanging it in his official visitor &apos;s waiting room .
In 1650 in Rome Velázquez also painted a portrait of his servant , Juan de Pareja , now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City .
This portrait procured his election into the Academy of St. Luke . Purportedly Velázquez created this portrait as a warm ##AT##-##AT## up of his skills before his portrait of the Pope .
It captures in great detail Pareja &apos;s countenance and his somewhat worn and patched clothing with an impressive economy of brushwork ; it is one of his best known pieces of portraiture .
One of the infantas , Margarita , the eldest daughter of the new Queen , appears to be subject of Las Meninas ( 1656 , English : The Maids of Honour ) , Velázquez &apos;s magnum opus .
However , in looking at the various viewpoints of the painting it is unclear as to who or what is the true subject .
Is it the royal daughter , or perhaps the painter himself ?
The answer may lie in the image on the back wall , depicting the King and Queen . Is this image a mirror , in which case the King and Queen are standing where we stand ?
Are they the subject of Velazquez &apos;s work ? Or is the work simply a court painting ?
Much is still in speculation about the true subject of this masterpiece , and many of the questions that we ask may never be truly answered .
Created four years before his death , it serves as an outstanding example of the European baroque period of art .
An apotheosis of the work has been effected since its creation ; Luca Giordano , a contemporary Italian painter , referred to it as the &quot; theology of painting , &quot; and the eighteenth century the Englishman Thomas Lawrence cited it as the &quot; philosophy of art , &quot; so decidedly capable of producing its desired effect .
That effect has been variously interpreted ; Dale Brown points out an interpretation that , in inserting within the work a faded portrait of the king and queen hanging on the back wall , Velázquez has ingeniously prognosticated the fall of the Spanish empire that was to gain momentum following his death .
Another interpretation is that the portrait is in fact a mirror , and that the painting itself is in the perspective of the King and Queen , hence their reflection can be seen in the mirror on the back wall .
It is said the king painted the honorary Cruz Roja ( Red Cross ) of the Orden de Santiago ( Order of Santiago ) on the breast of the painter as it appears today on the canvas .
However , Velázquez did not receive this honor of knighthood until three years after execution of this painting . Even the King of Spain could not make his favorite a belted knight without the consent of the commission established to inquire into the purity of his lineage .
The aim of these inquiries would be to prevent the appointment to positions of anyone found to have even a taint of heresy in their lineage — that is , a trace of Jewish or Moorish blood or contamination by trade or commerce in either side of the family for many generations . The records of this commission have been found among the archives of the Order of Santiago .
Velázquez was awarded the honor in 1659 .
His occupation as plebeian and tradesman was justified because , as painter to the king , he was evidently not involved in the practice of &quot; selling &quot; pictures .
There were essentially only two patrons of art in Spain — the church and the art ##AT##-##AT## loving king and court .
Bartolome Esteban Murillo was the artist favored by the church , while Velázquez was patronized by the crown . One difference , however , deserves to be noted .
Murillo , who toiled for a rich and powerful church , left little means to pay for his burial , while Velázquez lived and died in the enjoyment of good salaries and pensions .
One of his final works was Las hilanderas ( The Spinners ) , painted circa 1657 , representing either the interior of the royal tapestry works or a depiction of Ovid &apos;s Fable of Arachne , depending on interpretation .
It has recently been suggested that the tapestry in the background is based on Titian &apos; s The Rape of Europa , or , more probably , the copy that Rubens painted in Madrid .
&#91; 3 &#93; It is full of light , air and movement , featuring vibrant colors and careful handling .
Anton Raphael Mengs said this work seemed to have been painted not by the hand but by the pure force of will .
It displays a concentration of all the art ##AT##-##AT## knowledge Velázquez had gathered during his long artistic career of more than forty years . The scheme is simple — a confluence of varied and blended red , bluish ##AT##-##AT## green , grey and black .
Until the nineteenth century , little was known outside of Spain of Velázquez &apos;s work . His paintings mostly escaped being stolen by the French marshals during the Peninsular War .
In 1828 Sir David Wilkie wrote from Madrid that he felt himself in the presence of a new power in art as he looked at the works of Velázquez , and at the same time found a wonderful affinity between this artist and the British school of portrait painters , especially Henry Raeburn .
He was struck by the modern impression pervading Velázquez &apos;s work in both landscape and portraiture .
Presently , his technique and individuality have earned Velázquez a prominent position in the annals of European art , and he is often considered a father of the Spanish school of art . Although acquainted with all the Italian schools and a friend of the foremost painters of his day , he was strong enough to withstand external influences and work out for himself the development of his own nature and his own principles of art .
Velázquez is often cited as a key influence on the art of Édouard Manet , important when considering that Manet is often cited as the bridge between realism and Impressionism .
Calling Velázquez the &quot; painter of painters , &quot; Manet admired Velázquez &apos;s use of vivid brushwork in the midst of the baroque academic style of his contemporaries and built upon Velázquez &apos;s motifs in his own art .
The importance of Velázquez &apos;s art even today is evident in considering the respect with which twentieth century painters regard his work . Pablo Picasso presented the most durable homages to Velázquez in 1957 when he recreated Las Meninas in 58 variations , in his characteristically cubist form .
Although Picasso was concerned that his reinterpretations of Velázquez &apos;s painting would be seen merely as copies rather than unique representations , the enormous works — including the largest he had produced since Guernica in 1937 — earned a position of relevance in the Spanish canon of art . Picasso retained the general form and positioning of the original in the framework of his avant ##AT##-##AT## garde cubist style .
Salvador Dalí , as with Picasso in anticipation of the tercentennial of Velázquez &apos;s death , created in 1958 a work entitled Velázquez Painting the Infanta Margarita With the Lights and Shadows of His Own Glory .
The color scheme shows Dalí &apos;s serious tribute to Velázquez ; the work also functioned , as in Picasso &apos;s case , as a vehicle for the presentation of newer theories in art and thought — nuclear mysticism , in Dalí &apos;s case .
The Anglo ##AT##-##AT## Irish painter Francis Bacon found Velázquez &apos;s portrait of Pope Innocent X to be one of the greatest portraits ever made .
He created several expressionist variations of this piece in the 1950s ; however , Bacon &apos;s paintings presented a more gruesome image of the pope , who had now been dead for centuries .
One such famous variation , entitled Figure with Meat ( 1954 ) , shows the pope between two halves of a bisected cow .
Velazquez &apos; daughter was an ancestress of Marquises de Monteleon , including Enriquetta Casado who in 1746 married Heinrich VI , Count Reuss zu Köstritz and had a large number of descendants among German aristocracy , among them Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands , father of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands &#91; 4 &#93; .
It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States . As of 31 December 2008 , the U.S. Navy had about 331,682 personnel on active duty and 124,000 in the Navy Reserve .
It operates 283 ships in active service and more than 3,700 aircraft . &#91; 2 &#93; The U.S. Navy is the largest in the world ; its battle fleet tonnage is greater than that of the next 13 largest combined .
The mission of the United States Navy is to protect and defend the right of the United States and our allies to move freely on the oceans and to protect our country against her enemies .
The United States Navy serves as a seaborne branch of the Military of the United States . 10 U.S.C.
In the early stages of the American Revolutionary War , the establishment of an official navy was an issue of debate among the members of the Continental Congress .
While Congress deliberated , it received word that two unarmed British supply ships from England were heading towards Quebec without escort .
A plan was drawn up to intercept the ships — however , the armed vessels to be used were owned not by Congress , but by individual colonies .
Of greater significance , then , was an additional plan to equip two ships that would operate under the direct authority of Congress to capture British supply ships .
This was not carried out until 13 October 1775 , when George Washington announced that he had taken command of three armed schooners under Continental authority to intercept any British supply ships near Massachusetts .
The Continental Navy achieved mixed results ; it was successful in a number of engagements and raided many British merchant vessels , but it lost 24 of its vessels &#91; 11 &#93; and at one point was reduced to two in active service .
The United States would be without a navy for nearly a decade — a state of affairs that exposed its merchant ships to a series of attacks by Barbary pirates . The sole armed maritime presence between 1790 and the launching of the U.S. Navy &apos;s first warships in 1797 was the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service ( USRCS ) , the primary &quot; ancestor &quot; of the U.S. Coast Guard .
Following an undeclared Quasi ##AT##-##AT## War with France , the U.S. Navy saw substantial action in the War of 1812 , where it was victorious in numerous single ##AT##-##AT## ship duels with the Royal Navy . The Navy drove all significant British forces off the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain and prevented them from becoming British controlled zones of conflict .
The navy conducted the U.S. military &apos;s first large ##AT##-##AT## scale amphibious joint operation by successfully landing 12,000 army troops with their equipment in one day at Veracruz , Mexico . When larger guns were needed to bombard Veracruz Navy volunteers landed large navy guns and manned them in the successful bombardment of the city and its surrender .
This successful landing and capture of Veracruz eventually opening the way for the capture of Mexico City and the end of the war . &#91; 5 &#93; The United States Navy established itself as a player in American foreign policy through the actions of Commodore Matthew Perry in Japan , which resulted in the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854 .
The Navy saw little action during World War I , but grew into a formidable force in the years prior to World War II . Though ultimately unsuccessful , Japan attempted to allay this strategic threat with the 1941 surprise attack on Pearl Harbor .
Following American entry into the war , the U.S. Navy grew tremendously as the United States was faced with a two ##AT##-##AT## front war on the seas .
It achieved notable acclaim in the Pacific Theater , where it was instrumental to the Allies &apos; successful &quot; island hopping &quot; campaign .
&#91; 12 &#93; The U.S. Navy participated in many significant battles , including the Battle of the Coral Sea , the Battle of Midway , the Battle of the Philippine Sea , the Battle of Leyte Gulf , and the Battle of Okinawa .
By 1943 , the Navy &apos;s size was larger than the combined fleets of all the other combatant nations in World War II .
The Navy was a major participant in the Vietnam War , blockaded Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis , and , through the use of ballistic missile submarines , became an important aspect of the United States &apos; nuclear strategic deterrence policy .
The United States Navy conducted various combat operations in the Persian Gulf against Iran in 1987 and 1988 , most notably Operation Praying Mantis .
The Navy was extensively involved in Operation Urgent Fury , Operation Desert Shield , Operation Desert Storm , Operation Deliberate Force , Operation Allied Force , Operation Desert Fox and Operation Southern Watch .
The U.S. Navy has also been involved in Search and Rescue / Search and Salvage operations , some times in conjunction with vessels of other countries as well as with U.S. Coast Guard ships . Two examples are the 1966 Palomares B ##AT##-##AT## 52 crash incident and search for the nuclear bombs , and the Task Force 71 of the Seventh Fleet operation in search for Korean Air Lines Flight 007 shot down by the Soviets on Sept . 1 , 1983 .
The United States Navy continues to be a major support to American interests in the 21st century . Since the end of the Cold War , it has shifted its focus from preparations for large ##AT##-##AT## scale war with the Soviet Union to special operations and strike missions in regional conflicts .
&#91; 19 &#93; The Navy participated in Operation Enduring Freedom , Operation Iraqi Freedom , and is a major participant in the ongoing War on Terror , largely in this capacity .
Naval Special Warfare Command provides vision , leadership , doctrinal guidance , resources and oversight to ensure component maritime special operations forces are ready to meet the operational requirements of combatant commanders . The NSW has 5,400 total active ##AT##-##AT## duty personnel , including 2,450 SEALs and 600 Special Warfare Combatant ##AT##-##AT## craft Crewmen .
&#91; 25 &#93; Historically , the United States Navy has enjoyed a unique relationship with the United States Marine Corps ( USMC ) , partly because they both specialize in seaborne operations . At the very top level of civilian organization , the USMC is part of the Department of the Navy and reports to the Secretary of the Navy .
However , it is considered to be a distinct , separate service branch and not a subset of the Navy ; the highest ranking Marine officer , the Commandant of the Marine Corps , does not report to a Navy officer . Marine Corps Medal of Honor recipients are awarded the Navy variant and Marines are eligible to receive the Navy Cross .
The United States Naval Academy trains Marine Corps commissioned officers while Navy officers undergo instruction by Marine NCO Drill Instructors , in addition to their normal Recruit Division Commander . Naval Aviation includes Navy and Marine aviators , flight officers , and aircrew .
The largest overseas base is in Yokosuka , Japan , &#91; 41 &#93; which serves as the homeport for the Navy &apos;s largest forward ##AT##-##AT## deployed fleet and is a significant base of operations in the Western Pacific . European operations revolve around facilities in Italy and Greece with Naples as the homeport for the Sixth Fleet and CNRE Command Naval Region Europe .
In the Middle East , naval facilities are located almost exclusively in countries bordering the Persian Gulf , with Manama , Bahrain serving as the headquarters of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command and U.S. Fifth Fleet .
A carrier is typically deployed along with a host of additional vessels , forming a carrier battle group . The supporting ships , which usually include three or four Aegis -equipped cruisers and destroyers , a frigate , and two attack submarines , are tasked with protecting the carrier from air , missile , sea , and undersea threats as well as providing additional strike capabilities themselves .
Amphibious transport docks are warships that embark , transport , and land Marines , supplies , and equipment in a supporting role during amphibious warfare missions .
With a landing platform , amphibious transport docks also have the capability to serve as secondary aviation support for an expeditionary group .
All amphibious transport docks can operate helicopters , LCACs , and other conventional amphibious vehicles while the newer San Antonio class of ships has been explicitly designed to operate all three elements of the Marines &apos; &quot; mobility triad &quot; : Expeditionary Fighting Vehicles ( EFVs ) , the V ##AT##-##AT## 22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft , and the previously mentioned LCACs .
Amphibious transport docks are named for cities , except for USS Mesa Verde ( LPD ##AT##-##AT## 19 ) , named for Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado , and two of the three ships named in memory of the September 11 , 2001 attacks : USS New York ( LPD ##AT##-##AT## 21 ) , for the state of New York , and USS Somerset ( LPD ##AT##-##AT## 25 ) for Somerset County , Pennsylvania .
The dock landing ship is a medium amphibious transport that is designed specifically to support and operate Landing Craft Air Cushions ( LCACs ) , though it is able to operate other amphibious assault vehicles in the United States inventory as well .
Dock landing ships are normally deployed as a component of an expeditionary strike group &apos;s amphibious assault contingent , operating as a secondary launch platform for LCACs . All dock landing ships are named after locations in the United States .
Modern U.S. frigates mainly perform anti ##AT##-##AT## submarine warfare for carrier strike groups and amphibious expeditionary groups and provide armed escort for supply convoys and merchant shipping .
They are designed to protect friendly ships against hostile submarines in low to medium threat environments , using torpedoes and LAMPS helicopters .
The U.S. Navy expects to retire and replace its current class of frigates by 2020 . &#91; 52 &#93; As in the case of destroyers , frigates are named after naval heroes .
All U.S. battleships have been decommissioned and all but two have been stricken from the Naval Vessel Register .
Designed to engage other capital ships in open sea warfare , battleships were the Navy &apos;s largest and most important vessels until the mid ##AT##-##AT## 20th century .
The rise of aircraft carriers in World War II led to the declining importance of battleships and the Navy relegated them to the roles of fire support and escort .
Following a long period of inactivity , the Iowa ##AT##-##AT## class battleships were recommissioned in the 1980s to augment the Navy &apos;s size and were upgraded with Tomahawk cruise missile capability .
They were decommissioned for the final time in the early 1990s due in part to their high maintenance costs and the Cold War &apos;s end . All battleships except USS Kearsarge ( BB ##AT##-##AT## 5 ) were named for states .
The primary missions of submarines in the U.S. Navy are peacetime engagement , surveillance and intelligence , special operations , precision strikes , battlegroup operations , and control of the seas . &#91; 53 &#93; The U.S. Navy operates two types : ballistic submarines and attack submarines .
Sea attack submarines are typically named for cities while land attack submarines ( Virginia- and converted Ohio ##AT##-##AT## class boats ) are typically named for states . Earlier attack submarines were named for &quot; denizens of the deep &quot; , while earlier ballistic missile submarines were named for &quot; famous Americans &quot; ( although many of them were actually foreigners ) .
The SEALs derive their name from the environments in and from which they can operate : SEa , Air , and Land .
Their distinguishing specialty , however , is maritime operations — striking from and returning to the sea . &#91; 58 &#93; The SEALs are a flexible group of naval Special Forces who are trained to conduct clandestine warfare , most often in small ##AT##-##AT## unit actions .
Navy special operations fall under the jurisdiction of Naval Special Warfare Command , the Navy branch of United States Special Operations Command .
Although not under the jurisdiction of NSW Command , Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Units often work closely with special operations teams .
Trained to be combat ##AT##-##AT## ready and highly mobile , EOD units are entrusted with nullifying hazardous ordnance in a number of different maritime environments .
NECC consolidates , aligns and integrates diverse expeditionary capabilities and combat support elements to create consistent expeditionary practices , procedures , requirements and logistics in the battle space .
NECC ’ s enterprise approach will yield improved efficiencies and effectiveness through economies of scale and common processes .
The Maritime Expeditionary Security Force ’ s ( MESF ) ( formerly known as Naval Coastal Warfare ) primary mission is force protection conducted through fleet support with operations around the world . Anti ##AT##-##AT## Terrorism and Force Protection missions include harbor and homeland defense , coastal surveillance , and special missions .
MESF units deploy worldwide to detect , deter , and defend an area , unit , or High Value Asset . Recent locations include the United States , Korea , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain , United Arab Emirates , and Egypt .
Coastal and harbor defense and protection of naval assets are placed under the jurisdiction of two Naval Coastal Warfare Groups : one for the Pacific Fleet and one for the Atlantic Fleet . Within these groups are Mobile Security Squadrons and Naval Coastal Warfare Squadrons .
MSSs deploy Mobile Security Detachments that provide force protection for high value naval targets in ports and harbors where U.S. shore infrastructure is limited or does not exist . Naval Coastal Warfare Squadrons provide surveillance and security in harbors , coasts , and inshore areas .
MIUWUs are charged with security , observation , and communications support for commanders operating in an inshore / coast environment , including anchorages and harbors . In the same operating environment , IBUs manage water craft for security , interdiction and surveillance .
The current naval jack of the United States is the First Navy Jack , traditionally regarded as having been used during the American Revolutionary War . On 31 May 2002 , Secretary of the Navy Gordon England directed all U.S. naval ships to fly the First Navy Jack for the duration of the War on Terrorism .
Many ships chose to shift colors later that year on the first anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . The previous naval jack was a blue field with 50 white stars , identical to the canton of the ensign ( the flag of the United States ) both in appearance and size , and continues to remain in use with vessels of the U.S. Coast Guard .
A jack of similar design was used in 1794 , though with 13 stars arranged in a 3 – 2 – 3 – 2 – 3 pattern . When a ship is moored or anchored , the jack is flown from the bow of the ship while the ensign is flown from the stern .
Over the course of the Navy &apos;s 207 ##AT##-##AT## year existence , a distinct jargon has evolved among American sailors and has become a normal part of their everyday speech .
Modern U.S. Navy slang draws from a number of varied sources .

No discussion of prices is needed with the bus , as they used fixed rates .
To give you an idea of prices , buses running from Cotonou to Natitingou ( or vice versa ) costs 7.500f CFA one way , and Cotonou to Parakou ( or vice versa ) costs 5.500f CFA .
These are examples , because there are also buses that go as far as Tanguieta and Malanville .
Traffic is chaotic and the rules of the road are rarely enforced .
If you are planning on driving yourself in Benin , an International Driver &apos;s license is required .
Traffic flows on the same side of the road as the US and Canada .
Hiring a local guide is recommended .
Police roadblocks at night occur regularly and traveling alone with a driver ( especially if you are a woman ) may put the driver in an awkward position explaining and / or bribing the police .
There are many pirogues ( kayak / canoe ) used for the fishing industry . Normally one can use a pirogue to visit the lake villages .
The best way to stay safe in Benin is to always always always be in the presence of a local person whom you can trust , such as a friend or even a hired tourist guide . They know which areas are safe and which are not , they know the prices of things so you won &apos;t get ripped off , they speak the native languages , they know which venues sell good food that is safe for westerners to eat .
Benin is a peaceful country and the people are very kind and generous , but that being said muggings and robberies occur everywhere no matter how peaceful the place so be on guard . If you are a victim of a crime , contact the Gendarme ( Police ) immediately .
Along with vaccines against polio , hepatitis A and B , Measles , Mumps , Rubella , Lock Jaw , Rabies and all the other standard childhood vaccines ( as per Canadian public school standards ) . AIDS is an issue in Benin as in all sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan African countries ; use of a condom is highly recommended if entering into a sexual relationship with a Beninese partner .

One of Bermuda &apos;s few taxes is its steep import duty . This varies depending on the item and the importer .
If the cost of the vehicle before it is landed is less than BD $ 10,000 , the duty is 80 % . For cars costing $ 10,000 or greater , before landing , the duty is 100 % .
The dealer must add his own profit margin on top of this . Each person arriving on the island is allowed a $ 100 exemption , but if a visitor is deemed to be carrying more than that amount he / she will be subject to the duty on the excess value .

Bordeaux is a flat city , built on the banks of the Garonne River . It is also the largest French city in area and geographically one of the largest in Europe .
The Garonne merges a dozen kilometers below the city with another river , the Dordogne River to form the Gironde Estuary , which is biggest estuary in France .
There are no skyscrapers in Bordeaux , just a few tall buildings due to the weakness of the subsoil , which explains its sprawl . The center of the town has retained its traditional stone mansions and smart terraces , hence the reason behind the city being called &quot; Little Paris &quot; .
The main train station ( Gare Saint Jean ) is located about 4km from the center of town .
Several trains per day ( around one every two hours ) go north ( to Paris , about 3 hours 30 , Angoulème , Poitiers ) , south ( to Toulouse , Marseille , Montpellier ( about 4 to 5 hours ) , up to Nice ) , and east ( to Périgueux and Clermont ##AT##-##AT## Ferrand ) .
If you &apos;re travelling with bikes European Bike Express &#91; 3 &#93; run a route from north of Leeds , stopping through the UK to Dover and then on towards Bayonne via Bordeaux .
Passengers normally travel from the UK to Europe .
Bordeaux is quite a big city , however most of the interesting attractions are in the town center .
The most interesting way to explore the city is by walking . As most of the town center is a &apos; pedestrian area &apos; , this is easy to do .
Three efficient tramway lines are also available ( A , B and C ) , tickets cost 1 , 40 Euros and covers unlimited journeys within one hour of validation .
It is possible to rent roller ##AT##-##AT## skates at a small sport ##AT##-##AT## shop called &quot; Pierre Qui Roule &quot; , situated on the western side of Place Gambetta , north of the pedestrian area .
Tickets can be purchased on the bus , however that &apos;s expensive and you cannot change buses with the tickets bought on the bus . The best thing is to buy tickets either at the TBC agencies ( Gare Saint ##AT##-##AT## Jean , Gambetta , Quinconces ) , at almost any tobacconist , or at the tourist offices ( Quinconces , Gare Saint ##AT##-##AT## Jean ) .
You have also the possibility to buy tickets that will enable you to access freely the bus network for one to six days - those tickets cost from 3.75 up to 11.80 euros . Students and elderly persons can buy tickets at a reduced price .
Avoid the buses on peak hours ( 8 ##AT##-##AT## 10AM , 4 ##AT##-##AT## 7PM ) , as the town center is usually totally jammed ( and cars often block bus tracks ) , and buses are overcrowded .
It is managed by the CGFTE , and thus you can get in the boat using a standard bus ticket . The bus goes from the Southern part of Quai Richelieu , and to the Place Aristide Briand , very close to the Aquitaine Bridge ( one of the must ##AT##-##AT## see in Bordeaux ) .
A new tramway &#91; 4 &#93; serves the town , crossing the Garonne via the Pont de Pierre . A distinctive feature of the tramway is that within the inner city , it has no overhead wires , although this may change due to recent issues with the ground ##AT##-##AT## level power supply system .
The electric bus , called la navette du centre ##AT##-##AT## ville , is the only public transportation on pedestrian roads . There are no bus stops for this one : to board an electric bus , wave your hand to the driver - he will stop the bus and let you on .
Bordeaux gardens open : end March to end October - 8AM to 8PM ; end October to end March - 8AM to 6PM . Bordeaux gardens admission is free .
Bordeaux is a great city for learning- to learn a bit about French culture , consider visiting cinemas such as Utopia &#91; 9 &#93; or going to the city library in Meriadeck .
Bordeaux has made its wealth out of trade , and the local economic system relies heavily on shops and trading halls . The Pedestrian Center is basically full of stores of all kinds , from clothes to art , craftworks , food and wine etc .
Bordeaux is covered by the three major telecommunication operators in France : France Telecom ( Orange ) , Bouygues , and SFR .
If you have a GSM cellphone with an international subscription , you should be able to give calls from anywhere in the city . It is also possible to find phone cabins , but some have been removed recently due to their decreased usage .
Bordeaux is not a city known for insecurity , and if you respect some simple rules , you shouldn &apos;t have any problems .
There are a lot of interesting things to see close to Bordeaux .

Brandenburg ( German : Brandenburg ) , ( Lower Sorbian : Bramborska ; Upper Sorbian : Braniborska ) &#91; 1 &#93; is a historical region and a modern federal state in Germany . Brandenburg was historically composed of a larger amount of territory now located across the Oder River in western Poland .
Brandenburg is known for its nature .
There is one national park , the Lower Oder Valley National Park .
Besides , there are three UNESCO Biosphere Reserves , Flusslandschaft Elbe , Schorfheide ##AT##-##AT## Chorin , and Spreewald .
Within less than an hour , you can get out of the city and find yourself in the middle of a forest or a pretty village , at the banks of a lovely lake or in front of a medieval church or castle . The major attraction of Brandenburg is the city of Potsdam with its UNESCO world heritage .
However , besides Potsdam , there are plenty of less spectacular attractions that make Brandenburg worth a trip . The grey remainders of 40 years of communist ruling are gone , and now Brandenburg offers lots to discover .
Younger people normally do understand English , the older tend to speak Russian rather than English . Sorbian is spoken in a small region in the south bordering Saxony .
Since Berlin is located in the middle of Brandenburg , there are highways ( Autobahn ) to all major directions crossing through Brandenburg . Many places in Brandenburg can be reached by car within one or two hours from the center of Berlin .
The Berlin ##AT##-##AT## Brandenburg ##AT##-##AT## Public ##AT##-##AT## Traffic ##AT##-##AT## Network ( vbb ) co ##AT##-##AT## ordinates public transport in the region . There is also a consistent tariff system , so travelers can by a ticket for the entire journey even if they change from the train to buses .
The easiest way to get around is by car .
There are several highways ( Autobahn ) , that connect Berlin with different German regions - all leading through Brandenburg .
In addition , there are well maintained roads .
Public transport to many rural destinations is poor . There are a few railroad connections within Brandenburg and there are public buses , but travelers should check timetables for connections .

Today , Dijon is a cosmopolitan city , with universities in the center and industrial plants on the outskirts . Traffic is restricted in the center of the city , so many parts of central Dijon are quiet and relaxing .

From the airport , taxis are available but not inexpensive ( about 200kn ) .
Reliable bus service to the Old City is available through Atlas , and meet all scheduled flights , with the drop off location in the Old City at Pile Gate or the bus station in Gruž .
While there are a great many pensions and the tourist office at the Pile Gate location , most hotels ( with the exception of the Hilton ) are not located there .
Pile Gate does happen to be major city bus stop though , with buses quickly taking people to nearly any location in the city including the main swath of hotels on Babin Kuk .
Tickets can be bought on the bus or more cheaply from the news stands at Pile .
Vendors will understand &apos; bus ticket &apos; ( or &apos; autobusne karte &apos; in Croatian ) as they see a great many tourists through this location .
There is no train to Dubrovnik , although you can take a train to Split and then travel by bus to Dubrovnik .
